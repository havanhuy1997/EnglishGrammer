	<div class="section"> <B>A</B> <br>Study this example situation:</div><br>
    Last month Gary was in hospital for an operation. Liz didn't know this, so she didn't go to visit him. They met a few days ago. Liz said:<br>
If I had known you were in hospital, I would have gone to visit you.<br>
Liz said: If I had known you were in hospital... . The real situation was that she didn't know he was in hospital.<br>
When you are talking about the past, you use if + had ('d) ... (if I had known/been/done etc.):<br>
* I didn't see you when you passed me in the street. If I'd seen you, of course I would have said hello. (but I didn't see you)<br>
* I decided to stay at home last night. I would have gone out if I hadn't been so tired. (but I was tired)<br>
* If he had been looking where he was going, he wouldn't have walked into the wall. (but he wasn't looking)<br>
* The view was wonderful. If I'd had a camera, I would have taken some photographs. (but I didn't have a camera)<br>
Compare:<br>
* I'm not hungry. If I was hungry, I would eat something. (now)<br>
* I wasn't hungry. If I had been hungry, I would have eaten something. (past)<br>

</div>


<div class="sec">
	<div class="section"> <B>B</B> <br>Do not use would in the if-part of the sentence. We use would in the other part of the sentence:</div><br>
    * If I had seen you, I would have said hello. (not 'If I would have seen you')<br>
Note that 'd can be would or had:<br>
* If I'd seen you, (I'd seen = I had seen)<br>
I'd have said hello. (I'd have said = I would have said)<br>

</div>


<div class="sec">
	<div class="section"> <B>C</B> <br>We use had (done) in the same way after wish. I wish something had happened = I am sorry that it didn't happen:</div><br>
    * I wish I'd known that Gary was ill. I would have gone to see him. (but I didn't know)<br>
* I feel sick. I wish I hadn't eaten so much cake. (I ate too much cake)<br>
* Do you wish you had studied science instead of languages? (you didn't study science)<br>
* The weather was cold while we were away. I wish it had been warmer.<br>
Do not use would have... after wish in these sentences:<br>
* I wish it had been warmer. (not 'I wish it would have been')<br>

</div>


<div class="sec">
	<div class="section"> <B>D</B> <br>Compare would (do) and would have (done):</div><br>
    * If I had gone to the party last night, I would be tired now. (I am not tired now--present)<br>
If I had gone to the party last night, I would have met lots of people. (I didn't meet lots of people--past)<br>
Compare would have, could have and might have:<br>
* If the weather hadn't been so bad, we would have gone out.<br>
* If the weather hadn't been so bad, we could have gone out. (= we would have been able to go out)<br>
* If the weather hadn't been so bad, we might have gone out. (=perhaps we would have gone out)<br>
