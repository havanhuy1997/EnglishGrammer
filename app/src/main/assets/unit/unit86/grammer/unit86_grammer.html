	<div class="section"> <B>A</B> <br>We use much and little with uncountable nouns:</div><br>
    much time much luck little energy little money<br>
We use many and few with plural nouns:<br>
many friends many people few cars few countries<br>

<div class="sec">
	<div class="section"> <B>B</B> <br>We use a lot of/lots of/plenty of with uncountable and plural nouns:</div><br>
    a lot of luck lots of time plenty of money a lot of friends lots of people plenty of ideas<br>
Plenty = more than enough:<br>
* There's no need to hurry. We've got plenty of time.<br>
* I've had plenty to eat. I don't want any more.<br>

</div>


<div class="sec">
	<div class="section"> <B>C</B> <br>We use much/many especially in negative sentences and questions. A lot (of) is also possible:</div><br>
    * We didn't spend much money. (or We didn't spend a lot of money.)<br>
* Do you know many people? (or Do you know a lot of people?)<br>
* I don't go out much. (or I don't go out a lot.)<br>
In positive sentences a lot (of) is more usual. Much is unusual in positive sentences in spoken English:<br>
* We spent a lot of money. (not 'We spent much money')<br>
* He goes out a lot. (not 'He goes out much')<br>
You can use many in positive sentences, but a lot (of) is more usual in spoken English:<br>
* A lot of people (or Many people) drive too fast.<br>
But note that we use too much and so much in positive sentences:<br>
* We spent too much money.<br>

</div>


<div class="sec">
	<div class="section"> <B>D</B> <br>Little and few (without 'a') are negative ideas (= not much/not many):</div><br>

* He isn't popular. He has few friends. (= not many, not enough friends) You can say very little and very few:<br>
* There is very little time.<br>
* He has very few friends.<br>
A little and a few are more positive. A little = some, a small amount:<br>
* Let's go and have a drink. We've got a little time before the train leaves. (a little time = some time, enough<br>

* The village was very small. There were only a few houses.<br>
