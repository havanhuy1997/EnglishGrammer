	<div class="section"> <B>A</B> <br>Prefer to do and prefer doing</div><br>
    You can use 'prefer to (do)' or 'prefer ~ing' to say what you prefer in general:<br>
* I don't like cities. I prefer to live in the country. or I prefer living in the country.<br>
Study the differences in structure after prefer. We say:<br>
I prefer something to something else.<br>
I prefer doing something to doing something else.<br>
but I prefer to do something rather than (do) something else.<br>
* I prefer this coat to the coat you were wearing yesterday.<br>
* I prefer driving to travelling by train.<br>
but * I prefer to drive rather than travel by train.<br>
* Ann prefers to live in the country rather than (live) in a city.<br>

</div>


<div class="sec">
	<div class="section"> <B>B</B> <br>Would prefer (I'd prefer...)</div><br>
    We use 'would prefer' to say what somebody wants in a particular situation (not in general):<br>
* 'Would you prefer tea or coffee?' 'Coffee, please.'<br>
We say 'would prefer to do' (not 'doing'):<br>
* 'Shall we go by train?' 'Well, I'd prefer to go by car.' (not 'I'd prefer going')<br>
* I'd prefer to stay at home tonight rather than go to the cinema.<br>

</div>


<div class="sec">
	<div class="section"> <B>C</B> <br>Would rather (I'd rather...)</div><br>
    Would rather (do) = would prefer (to do). After would rather we use the infinitive without to.<br>
Compare:<br>
* 'Shall we go by train?' 'I'd prefer to go by car.'<br>
* 'Shall we go by train?' 'I'd rather go by car.' (not 'to go')<br>
* 'Would you rather have tea or coffee?' 'Coffee, please.'<br>
The negative is 'I'd rather not (do something)':<br>
* I'm tired. I'd rather not go out this evening, if you don't mind.<br>
* 'Do you want to go out this evening?' 'I'd rather not.'<br>
Study the structure after would rather:<br>
I'd rather do something than (do) something else.<br>
* I'd rather stay at home tonight than go to the cinema.<br>

</div>


<div class="sec">
	<div class="section"> <B>D</B> <br>I'd rather you did something</div><br>
    When you want somebody to do something, you can say 'I'd rather you did something':<br>
* 'Shall I stay here?' 'I'd rather you came with us.'<br>
* 'Shall I tell them the news?' 'No. I'd rather they didn't know.'<br>
* Shall I tell them or would you rather they didn't know?<br>
In this structure we use the past (came, did etc.), but the meaning is present or future, not past.<br>
Compare:<br>
* I'd rather cook the dinner now.<br>
but * I'd rather you cooked the dinner now. (not 'I'd rather you cook')<br>
The negative is 'I'd rather you didn't ...':<br>
* I'd rather you didn't tell anyone what I said.<br>
* 'Do you mind if I smoke?' 'I'd rather you didn't.'<br>
