<div class="sec">
	<div class="section"> <B>A</B> <br>We use can to say that something is possible or that somebody has the ability to do something.</div><br>
    * We use can + infinitive (can do/can see etc.):<br>
* We can see the lake from our bedroom window.<br>
* Can you speak any foreign languages?<br>
* I can come and see you tomorrow if you like.<br>
The negative is can't (= cannot):<br>
* I'm afraid I can't come to the party on Friday.<br>

</div>


<div class="sec">
	<div class="section"> <B>B</B> <br>(Be) able to ... is possible instead of can, but can is more usual:</div><br>
    * Are you able to speak any foreign languages?<br>
But can has only two forms, can (present) and could (past). So sometimes it is necessary to use (be) able to... Compare:<br>
* I can't sleep.<br>
but I haven't been able to sleep recently. (can has no present perfect)<br>
* Tom can come tomorrow.<br>
but Tom might be able to come tomorrow. (can has no infinitive)<br>

</div>


<div class="sec">
	<div class="section"> <B>C</B> <br>Could and was able to...</div><br>
    Sometimes could is the past of can. We use could especially with:<br>
see hear smell taste feel remember understand<br>
* When we went into the house, we could smell burning.<br>
* She spoke in a very low voice, but I could understand what she said.<br>
We also use could to say that somebody had the general ability or permission to do something:<br>
* My grandfather could speak five languages.<br>
* We were completely free. We could do what we wanted. (= we were allowed to do ...)<br>
We use could for general ability. But if we are talking about what happened in a particular situation, we use<br>
was/were able to... or managed to... (not could):<br>
* The fire spread through the building quickly but everybody was able to escape.<br>
or ... everybody managed to escape. (but not 'could escape')<br>
* They didn't want to come with us at first but we managed to persuade them.<br>
or ... we were able to persuade them. (but not 'could persuade')<br>
Compare:<br>
* Jack was an excellent tennis player. He could beat anybody. he had the general ability to beat anybody)<br>
but<br>
* Jack and Alf had a game of tennis yesterday. Alf played very well but in the end Jack managed to beat<br>
him. or ... was able to beat him. (= he managed to beat him in this particular game)<br>
The negative couldn't (could not) is possible in all situations:<br>
* My grandfather couldn't (could not) is possible in all situations<br>
* We tried hard but we couldn't persuade them to come with us.<br>
* Alf played well but he couldn't beat Jack.<br>
