When there are two colour adjectives, we use and:<br>
a black and white dress<br>
a black and white dress a red, white and green flag<br>
a black and white dress a red, white and green flag but a long black dress (not 'a long and black dress')<br>

<div class="sec">
	<div class="section"> <B>C</B> <br>We say 'the first two days', 'the next few weeks', 'the last ten minutes' etc.:</div><br>
    * I didn't enjoy the first two days of the course. (not 'the two first days')<br>
* They'll be away for the next few weeks. (not 'the few next weeks')<br>

<div class="sec">
	<div class="section"> <B>D</B> <br>We use adjectives after be/get/become/seem:</div><br>
    * Be careful!<br>
* I'm tired and I'm getting hungry.<br>
* As the film went on, it became more and more boring.<br>
* Your friend seems very nice.<br>
We also use adjectives to say how somebody/something looks, feels, sounds, tastes or smells:<br>
* You look tired./I feel tired./She sounds tired.<br>
* The dinner smells good.<br>
* This tea tastes a bit strange.<br>
But to say how somebody does something you must use an adverb (see Units 99-100):<br>
* Drive carefully! (not 'Drive careful')<br>
* Susan plays the piano very well. (not 'plays...very good')<br>
