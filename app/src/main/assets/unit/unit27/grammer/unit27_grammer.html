<div class="sec">
	<div class="section"> <B>A</B> <br>We use could in a number of ways. Sometimes could is the past of can (see Unit 26C):</div><br>
    * Listen. I can hear something. (now)<br>
* I listened. I could hear something. (past)<br>
But could is not only used in this way. We also in the future (especially to make a suggestion). For<br>
example:<br>
* A: What shall we do this evening?<br>
B: We could go to the cinema.<br>
* It's a nice day. We could go for a walk.<br>
* When you go to New York next month, you could stay with Barbara.<br>
* A: If you need money, why don't you ask Karen?<br>
B: Yes, I suppose I could.<br>
Can is also possible in these sentences ('We can go for a walk,' etc.). Could is less sure than can. You must use could (not 'can') when you don't really mean what you say. For example:<br>
* I'm so angry with him. I could kill him! (not 'I can kill him')<br>

</div>


<div class="sec">
	<div class="section"> <B>B</B> <br>We also use could to say that something is possible now or in the future:</div><br>
    * The phone is ringing. It could be Tim.<br>
* I don't know when they'll be here. They could arrive at any time.<br>
Can is not possible in these examples (not 'It can be Tim')<br>
In these sentences could is similar to might (see Unit 29-30):<br>
* The phone is ringing. It might be Tim.<br>

</div>


<div class="sec">
	<div class="section"> <B>C</B> <br>Compare could (do) and could have (done):</div><br>
    * I'm so tired. I could sleep for a week. (now)<br>
* I was so tired. I could have slept for a week. (past)<br>
Most often, we use could have (done) for things which were possible but did not happen:<br>
* Why did you stay at a hotel when to New York? You could have stayed with Barbara. (= you had opportunity to stay with her but you didn't)<br>
* Jack fell off a ladder yesterday but he's all right. He's lucky - he could have hurt himself badly. (but he didn't hurt himself)<br>
* The situation was bad but it could have been worse.<br>

</div>


<div class="sec">
	<div class="section"> <B>D</B> <br>Sometimes could means 'would be able to...':</div><br>
    * We could go away if we had enough money.(= we would be able to go away)<br>
* I don't know how you work so hard. I couldn't do it.<br>
Could have (done) = would have been able to (do):<br>
* Why didn't Liz apply for the job? She could have got it.<br>
* We could have gone away if we'd had enough money.<br>
* The trip was cancelled last week. Paul couldn't have gone anyway because he was ill. (= he wouldn't have been able to go)<br>
* You did very well to pass the exam. I'm sure I couldn't have passed it. (= I wouldn't have been able to pass it if I had taken it)<br>
