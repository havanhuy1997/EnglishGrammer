	<div class="section"> <B>A</B> <br>Had better (I'd better/you'd better etc.)</div><br>
    I'd better do something = It is advisable to do it. If I don't, there will be a problem or a danger:<br>
* I have to meet Ann in ten minutes. I'd better go now or I'll be late.<br>
* 'Shall I take an umbrella?' 'Yes, you'd better. It might rain.'<br>
* We'd better stop for petrol soon. The tank is almost empty.<br>
The negative is I'd better not (= I had better not):<br>
* A: Are you going out tonight?<br>
B: I'd better not. I've got a lot of work to do.<br>
* You don't look very well. You'd better not go to work today.<br>
You can use had better when you warn somebody that they must do something:<br>
* You'd better be on time./You'd better not be late. (or I'll be very angry)<br>
Note that:<br>
The form is 'had better' (usually 'I'd better/you'd better' etc. in spoken English):<br>
* I'd better phone Carol, hadn't I?<br>
Had is a past form, but in this expression the meaning is present or future, not past: * I'd better go to<br>
the bank now/tomorrow.<br>
We say 'I'd better do...' (not 'to do'):<br>
* It might rain. We'd better take an umbrella. (not 'we'd better to take')<br>

<div class="sec">
	<div class="section"> <B>B</B> <br>Had better and should</div><br>
    Had better is similar to should (see Unit 33A) but not exactly the same.<br>
We use had better only for a particular situation (not for things in general).<br>
You can use should in all types of situation to give an opinion or to give advice:<br>
* It's cold today. You'd better wear a coat when you go out. (a particular situation)<br>
* I think all drivers should wear seat belts. (in general - not 'had better wear')<br>
Also, with had better, there is always a danger or a problem if you don't follow the advice.<br>
Should only means 'it is a good thing to do'. Compare.<br>
* It's a great film. You should go and see it. (but no danger, no problem if you don't)<br>
* The film starts at 8.30. You'd better go now or you'll be late.<br>

</div>


<div class="sec">
	<div class="section"> <B>C</B> <br>It's time ...</div><br>
    You can say 'It's time (for somebody) to do something':<br>
* It's time to go home./It's time for us to go home.<br>
You can also say:<br>
* It's late. It's time we went home.<br>
Here we use the past (went) but the meaning is present or future, not past:<br>
* It's 10 o'clock and he's still in bed. It's time he got up. (not 'It's time he gets up')<br>
It's time you did something = 'you should have done it already or started it'. We often use this structure to<br>
criticise or to complain:<br>
* It's time the children were in bed. It's long after their bedtime.<br>
* The windows are very dirty. I think it's time we cleaned them.<br>
You can also say: It's about time.../It's high time... . This makes the criticism stronger:<br>
* Jack is a great talker. But it's about time he did something instead of )'just talking.<br>
* You're very selfish. It's high time you realised that you're not the most important person in the world.<br>
