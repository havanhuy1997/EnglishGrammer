	<div class="section"> <B>A</B> <br>We use I'll (= I will) when we decide to do something at the time of speaking:</div><br>
    * Oh, I've left the door open. I'll go and shut it.<br>
* 'What would you like to drink?' 'I'll have an orange juice, please.'<br>
* 'Did you phone Ruth?' 'Oh no, I forgot. I'll phone her now.'<br>
You cannot use the present simple (I do/I go etc.) in these sentences:<br>
* I'll go and shut the door. (not 'I go and shut')<br>
We often use I think I'll ... and I don't think I'll ...:<br>
* I feel a bit hungry. I think I'll have something to cat.<br>
* I don't think I'll go out tonight. I'm too tired.<br>
In spoken English the negative of will is usually won't (= will not):<br>
* I can see you're busy, so I won't stay long.<br>

</div>


<div class="sec">
	<div class="section"> <B>B</B> <br>Do not use will to talk about what you have already decided or arranged to do (see Units 19-20):</div><br>
    * I'm going on holiday next Saturday. (not 'I'll go')<br>
* Are you working tomorrow? (not 'will you work')<br>

</div>


<div class="sec">
	<div class="section"> <B>C</B> <br>We often use will in these situations:</div><br>
    Offering to do something<br>
* That bag looks heavy. I'll help you with it. (not 'I help')<br>
Agreeing to do something<br>
* A: You know that book I lent you. Can I have it back if you've finished with it?<br>
B: Of course. I'll give it to you this afternoon. (not 'I give')<br>
Promising to do something<br>
* Thanks for lending me the money. I'll pay you back on Friday. (not 'I pay')<br>
* I won't tell anyone what happened. I promise.<br>
Asking somebody to do something (Will you ...?)<br>
* Will you please be quiet? I'm trying to concentrate.<br>
* Will you shut the door, please?<br>
You can use won't to say that somebody refuses to do something:<br>
* I've tried to advise her but she won't listen. (= she refuses to listen)<br>
* The car won't start. I wonder what's wrong with it. (= the car 'refuses' to start)<br>

</div>


<div class="sec">
	<div class="section"> <B>D</B> <br>Shall I ...? Shall we ...?</div><br>
    Shall is used mostly in the questions shall I ...?/shall we ...?<br>
We use shall I ...?/shall we ...? to ask somebody's opinion (especially in offers or suggestions):<br>
* Shall I open the window? (= do you want me to open the window?)<br>
* 'Shall we go?' 'Just a minute. I'm not ready yet.'<br>
* Where shall we go this evening?<br>
Compare shall I ...? and will you ...?:<br>
* Shall I shut the door? (= do you want me to shut it?)<br>
* Will you shut the door? (= I want you to shut it)<br>
