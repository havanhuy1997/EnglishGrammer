	<div class="section"> <B>A</B> <br>A friend of mine/a friend of Tom's etc.</div><br>
    We say 'a friend of mine/yours/his/hers/ours/theirs' (not 'a friend of me/you/him' etc.)<br>

<div class="sec">
	<div class="section"> <B>B</B> <br>My own .../your own ... etc.</div><br>
    We use my/your/his/her/its/our/their before own:<br>
my own house your own car her own room<br>
You cannot say 'an own...' ('an own house', 'an own car' etc.)<br>
My own.../your own... (etc.) = something that is only mine/yours (etc.), not shared or borrowed:<br>
* I don't want to share a room with anybody. I want my own room.<br>
* Vera and George would like to have their own house. (not 'an own house')<br>
* It's a pity that the flat hasn't got its own entrance.<br>
* It's my own fault that I've got no money. I buy too many things I don't need.<br>
* Why do you want to borrow my car? Why can't you use your own?(= your own car)<br>
You can also use ... own... to say that you do something yourself instead of somebody else doing it for you.<br>
For example:<br>
* Brian usually cuts his own hair. (= he cuts it himself; he doesn't go to the hairdresser)<br>
* I'd like to have a garden so that I could grow my own vegetables. (= grow them myself instead of buying<br>
* I'd like to have a garden so that I could grow my own vegetables. (= grow them myself instead of buying them from shops)<br>
