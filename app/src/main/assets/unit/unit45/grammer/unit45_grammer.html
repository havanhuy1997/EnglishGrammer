	<div class="section"> <B>A</B> <br>Study this example situation:</div><br>
    The roof of Jill's house was damaged in a storm, so she arranged for somebody to repair it. Yesterday a workman came and did the job.<br>
Jill had the roof repaired yesterday.<br>
This means: Jill arranged for somebody else to repair the roof. She didn't repair it herself.<br>
We use have something done to say that we arrange for somebody else to do something for us.<br>
Compare:<br>
* Jill repaired the roof. (= she repaired it herself)<br>
* Jill had the roof repaired. (= she arranged for somebody else to repair it)<br>
Study these sentences:<br>
* Did Ann make the dress herself or did she have it made?<br>
* 'Are you going to repair the car yourself?' 'No, I'm going to have it repaired.'<br>
Be careful with word order. The past participle (repaired/cut etc.) is after the object (the roof your hair etc.):<br>
have + object + past participle<br>
Jill had the roof repaired yesterday.<br>
Where did you have your hair cut?<br>
Your hair looks nice. Have you had it cut?<br>
Julia has just had central heating installed in her house.<br>
We are having the house painted at the moment.<br>
How often do you have your car serviced?<br>
I think you should have that coat cleaned soon.<br>
I don't like having my photograph taken.<br>

<div class="sec">
	<div class="section"> <B>B</B> <br>You can also say 'get something done' instead of 'have something done' (mainly in informal spoken English):</div><br>
    * When are you going to get the roof repaired? (= have the roof repaired)<br>
* I think you should get your hair cut.<br>

</div>


<div class="sec">
	<div class="section"> <B>C</B> <br>Sometimes have something done has a different meaning. For example:</div><br>
    * Jill and Eric had all their money stolen while they were on holiday.<br>
Of course this does not mean that they arranged for somebody to steal their money. 'They had all their money stolen' means only: 'All their money was stolen from them.'<br>
With this meaning, we use have something done to say that something happens to somebody or their belongings. Usually what happens is not nice:<br>
* George had his nose broken in a fight.<br>
* Have you ever had your passport stolen?<br>
