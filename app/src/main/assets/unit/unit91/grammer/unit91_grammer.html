    The woman _who lives next_(relative clause) door is a doctor.<br>

A clause is a part of a sentence. A relative clause tells us which person or thing (or what kind of person or thing) the speaker means:<br>
* The woman who lives next door ... ('who lives next door' tells us which woman)<br>
* People who live in London ... ('who live in London' tells us what kind of people)<br>
We use who in a relative clause when we are talking about people (not things). We use who instead of<br>
We use who in a relative clause when we are talking about people (not things). We use who instead of he/she/they:<br>
the woman--she lives next door--is a doctor<br>
-> The woman who lives next door is a doctor.<br>
we know a lot of people--they live in London<br>
-> We know a lot of people who live in London.<br>
* An architect is someone who designs buildings.<br>
* What was the name of the man who lent you the money?<br>
* Anyone who wants to do the exam must enter before next Friday.<br>
You can also use that (instead of who):<br>
* The man that lives next door is very friendly.<br>
But sometimes you must use who (not 'that') for people - see Unit 94.<br>

<div class="sec">
	<div class="section"> <B>B</B> <br>When we are talking about things, we use that or which(not 'who') in a relative clause:</div><br>
    where is the cheese? - it was in the fridge<br>
-> Where is the cheese that was in the fridge?<br>
-> Where is the cheese which was in the fridge?<br>
* I don't like stories that have unhappy endings. (or ... stories which have ...)<br>
* Barbara works for a company that makes washing machines. (or ... a company which makes...)<br>
* The machine that broke down has now been repaired. (or The machine which broke<br>
* The machine that broke down has now been repaired. (or The machine which broke down ...)<br>
That is more usual than which. But sometimes you must use which (not 'that')--see Unit 94.<br>

</div>


<div class="sec">
	<div class="section"> <B>C</B> <br>You cannot use what in sentences like these:</div><br>
    *. Everything that happened was my fault. (not 'Everything what happened...')<br>
What = 'the thing(s) that';<br>
* What happened was my fault. (=the thing that happened)<br>

</div>


<div class="sec">
	<div class="section"> <B>D</B> <br>Remember that in relative clauses we use who/that/which instead of he/she/they/it. So we say:</div><br>
    * Do you know the woman who lives next door? (not '...the woman she lives next door')<br>
