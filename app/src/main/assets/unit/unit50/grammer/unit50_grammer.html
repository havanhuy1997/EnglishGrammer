<div class="sec">
	<div class="section"> <B>A</B> <br>There are two verbs in each of these sentences:</div><br>
    I have lost my keys.<br>
She can't come to the party.<br>
The hotel was built ten years ago.<br>
Where do you live?<br>
In these examples have/can't/was/do are auxiliary (= helping) verbs.<br>
You can use an auxiliary verb (without the rest of the sentence) when you don't want to repeat something:<br>
* 'Have you locked the door?' 'Yes, I have.' (= I have locked the door)<br>
* George wasn't working but Janet was. (= Janet was working)<br>
* She could lend me the money but she won't. (= she won't lend me the money)<br>
* 'Are you angry with me?' 'Of course I'm not.' (= I'm not angry)<br>
Use do/does/did for the present and past simple:<br>
* 'Do you like onions?' 'Yes, I do. (= I like onions)<br>
* 'Does Mark smoke?' 'He did but he doesn't any more.'<br>

</div>


<div class="sec">
	<div class="section"> <B>B</B> <br>We use have you?/isn't she?/do they? etc. to show polite interest in what somebody has said:</div><br>
    * 'I've just met Simon.' 'Oh, have you? How is he?'<br>
* 'Liz isn't very well today.' 'Oh,98 isn't she? What's wrong with her?'<br>
* 'It rained every day during our holiday.' 'Did it? What a pity!'<br>
Sometimes we use these 'short questions' to show surprise:<br>
* 'Jim and Nora are getting married.' 'Are they? Really?'<br>

</div>


<div class="sec">
	<div class="section"> <B>C</B> <br>We use auxiliary verbs with so and neither:</div><br>
    * 'I'm feeling tired.' 'So am L' (= I'm feeling tired too)<br>
* 'I never read newspapers.' 'Neither do L' (= I never read newspapers either)<br>
* Sue hasn't got a car and neither has Martin.<br>
Note the word order after so and neither (verb before subject):<br>
* I passed the exam and so did Tom. (not 'so Tom did')<br>
You can use nor instead of neither:<br>
* 'I can't remember his name.' 'Nor can L' or 'Neither can I'<br>
You can also use '...not ... either':<br>
* 'I haven't got any money.' 'Neither have I' or 'Nor have I' or 'I haven't either.'<br>

</div>


<div class="sec">
	<div class="section"> <B>D</B> <br>I think so/I hope so etc.</div><br>
    After some verbs you can use so when you don't want to repeat something:<br>
* 'Are those people English?' J think so.' (= I think they are English)<br>
* 'Will you be at home tomorrow morning?' 'I expect so.' (= I expect I'll be at home..)<br>
* 'Do you think Kate has been invited to the party?' 'I suppose so.'<br>
You can also say I hope so, I guess so and I'm afraid so.<br>
The usual negative forms are:<br>
I think so/I expect so -> I don't think so/I don't expect so<br>
I hope so/I'm afraid so/I guess so -> I hope not/I'm afraid not/I guess not<br>
I suppose so/I don't suppose so or I suppose not<br>
* 'Is that woman American?' 'I think so./I don't think so.'<br>
* 'Do you think it's going to rain?' J hope so./I hope not.' (not 'I don't hope so')<br>
