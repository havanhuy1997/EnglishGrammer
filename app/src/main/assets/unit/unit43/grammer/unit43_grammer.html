<div class="sec">
	<div class="section"> <B>A</B> <br>I was born ...</div><br>
    We say: I was born ... (not 'I am born'):<br>
past simple<br>
* I was born in Chicago.<br>
* Where were you born? (not 'where are you born')<br>
but present simple<br>
* How many babies are born everyday?<br>

</div>


<div class="sec">
	<div class="section"> <B>B</B> <br>Some verbs can have two objects. For example, give:</div><br>
    * We gave _the police_(object 1) _the information._(object 2) (= We gave the information to the police.)<br>
So it is possible to make two passive sentences:<br>
* The police were given the information. or The information was given to the police.<br>
Other verbs which can have two objects are: ask offer pay show teach tell<br>
When we use these verbs in the passive, most often we begin with the person:<br>
* I was offered the job but I refused it. (= they offered me the job)<br>
* You will be given plenty of time to decide. (= we will give you plenty of time)<br>
* Have you been shown the new machine? (= has anybody shown you ...?)<br>
* The men were paid L200 to do the work. (= somebody paid the men L200)<br>

</div>


<div class="sec">
	<div class="section"> <B>C</B> <br>I don't like being ...</div><br>
    The passive of doing/seeing etc. is being done/being seen etc. Compare:<br>
active: I don't like people telling me what to do.<br>
passive: I don5t like being told what to do.<br>
* I remember being given a toy drum on my fifth birthday. (= I remember somebody giving me a toy drum...)<br>
* Mr. Miller hates being kept waiting. (= he hates people keeping him waiting)<br>
* We managed to climb over the wall without being seen. (= ... without anybody seeing us)<br>

</div>


<div class="sec">
	<div class="section"> <B>D</B> <br>Get</div><br>
    Sometimes you can use get instead of be in the passive:<br>
* There was a fight at the party but nobody got hurt. (= nobody was hurt)<br>
* I don't often get invited to parties. (= I'm not often invited)<br>
* I'm surprised Ann didn't get offered the lob. (... Ann wasn't offered the job)<br>
You can use get to say that something happens to somebody or something, especially if this is unplanned<br>
or unexpected:<br>
* Our dog got run over by a car.<br>
You can use get only when things happen or change. For example, you cannot use get in these sentences:<br>
* Jill is liked by everybody. (not 'gets liked' - this is not a 'happening')<br>
* He was a mystery man. Nothing was known about him. (not 'got known')<br>
We use get mainly in informal spoken English. You can use be in all situations.<br>
We also use get in the following expressions (which are not passive in meaning):<br>
get married get divorced get dressed (= put on your clothes) get changed (= change your clothes)<br>
