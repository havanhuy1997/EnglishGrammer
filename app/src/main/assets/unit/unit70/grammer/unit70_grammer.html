<div class="sec">
	<div class="section"> <B>A</B> <br>Countable nouns can be singular or plural:</div><br>
    a dog a child the evening this party an umbrella dogs some children the evenings these parties<br>
a dog a child the evening this party an umbrella dogs some children the evenings these parties two umbrellas<br>

</div>


<div class="sec">
	<div class="section"> <B>B</B> <br>Before singular countable nouns you can use a/an:</div><br>
    * Goodbye! Have a nice evening.<br>
* Do you need an umbrella?<br>
You cannot use singular countable nouns alone (without a/the/my etc.):<br>
* She never wears a hat. (not 'She never wears hat')<br>
* Be careful of the dog. (not 'Be careful of dog')<br>
* What a beautiful day!<br>
* I've got a headache.<br>

</div>


<div class="sec">
	<div class="section"> <B>C</B> <br>We use a/an ... to say what kind of thing or person something/somebody is:</div><br>
    * A dog is an animal.<br>
* I'm an optimist.<br>
* Tim's father is a doctor.<br>
* Are you a good driver?<br>
* Jill is a really nice person.<br>
* What a lovely dress!<br>
We say that somebody has a long nose/a nice face/a strong heart etc.:<br>
* Jack has got a long nose. (not 'the long nose')<br>
In sentences like these, we use plural nouns alone (not with 'some'):<br>
* Dogs are animals.<br>
* Most of my friends are students.<br>
* Jill's parents are really nice people.<br>
* What awful shoes!<br>
* Jack has got blue eyes. (not 'the blue eyes')<br>
Remember to use a/an when you say what somebody's job is:<br>
* Sandra is a nurse. (not 'Sandra is nurse')<br>
* Would you like to be an English teacher?<br>

</div>


<div class="sec">
	<div class="section"> <B>D</B> <br>You can use some with plural countable nouns. We use some in two ways:</div><br>
    i) Some = a number of/a few of/a pair of:<br>
* I've seen some good films recently. (not 'I've seen good films')<br>
* Some friends of mine are coming to stay at the weekend.<br>
* I need some new sunglasses, (= a new pair of sunglasses)<br>
Do not use some when you are talking about things in general (see also Unit 74):<br>
* I love bananas. (not 'some bananas')<br>
* My aunt is a writer. She writes books. (not 'some books')<br>
Sometimes you can make sentences with or without some (with no difference in meaning):<br>
* There are (some) eggs in the fridge if you're hungry.<br>
ii) Some = some but not all<br>
* Some children learn very quickly. (but not all children)<br>
* Some police officers in Britain carry guns, but most of them don't.<br>
