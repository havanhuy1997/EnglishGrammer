    expect beg mean (= intend) would prefer would hate<br>
These verbs are followed by to... (infinitive). The structure can be:<br>
verb + to ...<br>
* We expected to be late.<br>
* Would you like to go now?<br>
* He doesn't want to know.<br>
or verb + object + to...<br>
* We expected Tom to be late.<br>
* Would you like me to go now?<br>
* He doesn't want anybody to know.<br>
Be careful with want. Do not say 'want that...':<br>
* Do you want me to come with you? (not 'Do you want that I come')<br>
After help you can use the infinitive with or without to. So you can say:<br>
* Can you help me to move this table? or Can you help me move this table?<br>

</div>


<div class="sec">
	<div class="section"> <B>B</B> <br>tell remind force enable teach order warn invite persuade get (= persuade, arrange for)</div><br>
    These verbs have the structure verb + object + to ... :<br>
* Can you remind me to phone Ann tomorrow?<br>
* Who taught you to drive?<br>
* I didn't move the piano by myself. I got somebody to help me.<br>
* Jim said the switch was dangerous and warned me not to touch it.<br>
In the next example, the verb is passive (was warned):<br>
* I was warned not to touch the switch.<br>
Note that you cannot use suggest with the structure verb + object + to ...<br>
* Jane suggested that I should buy a car. (not 'Jane suggested me to buy')<br>
For suggest, see Units 34 and 52.<br>

</div>


<div class="sec">
	<div class="section"> <B>C</B> <br>advise recommend encourage allow permit forbid</div><br>
    There are two possible structures after these verbs. Compare:<br>
verb + ~ing (without an object)<br>
* I wouldn't recommend staying in that hotel.<br>
* She doesn't allow smoking in the house.<br>
verb + object + to...<br>
* I wouldn't recommend anybody to stay in that hotel.<br>
* She doesn't allow us to smoke in the house.<br>
Compare these examples with (be) allowed (passive):<br>
* Smoking isn't allowed in the house.<br>
* We aren't allowed to smoke in the house.<br>

</div>


<div class="sec">
	<div class="section"> <B>D</B> <br>Make and let</div><br>
    These verbs have the structure verb + object + infinitive (without to):<br>
* The customs officer made Sally open her case. (not 'to open')<br>
* Hot weather makes me feel tired. (= causes me to feel tired)<br>
* Her parents wouldn't let her go out alone. (= wouldn't allow her to go out)<br>
* Let me carry your bag for you.<br>
We say 'make somebody do...' (not 'to do'), but the passive is '(be) made to do ...' (infinitive with to):<br>
* Sally was made to open her case (by the customs officer)<br>
