	<div class="section"> <B>A</B> <br>There and it'</div><br>
    We use there ... when we talk about something for the first time, to say that it exists:<br>
* There's a new restaurant in King Street. (not 'A new restaurant is in King Street')<br>
* The journey took a long time. There was a lot of traffic. (not 'It was a lot of traffic')<br>
* * Things are much more expensive now. There has been a big rise in the cost of living.<br>
It = a particular thing, place, fact, situation etc. (but see also Section C:<br>
* We went to the new restaurant. It's very good. (it = the restaurant)<br>
* 'Was the traffic bad?' 'Yes, it was terrible.' (it = the traffic)<br>
* I wasn't expecting them to come. It (= that they came) was a complete surprise.<br>
Compare:<br>
* I don't like this town. There's nothing to do here. It's a boring place.<br>
Note that there also means 'to/at/in that place':<br>
* The new restaurant is very good. I went there (= to the restaurant) last night.<br>
* When we arrived at the party, there were already a lot of people there (= at the party).<br>

<div class="sec">

    * Will there be many people at the party?<br>
* 'Is there a flight to Paris this evening?' 'There might be. I'll phone the airport.'<br>
* If people drove more carefully, there wouldn't be so many accidents.<br>
Also: there must have been, there should have been etc.:<br>
* There was a light on. There must have been somebody at home.<br>
Compare there and it:<br>

They live on a busy main road. It must be very noisy.<br>

<div class="sec">
	<div class="section"> <B>C</B> <br>We use it in sentences like this:</div><br>
    * It's dangerous to walk in the road. (It = to walk in the road)<br>
It is unusual to say 'To walk in the road is dangerous.' Normally we begin with It...<br>

* It's a pity (that) Sandra can't come to the party. (It = that Sandra can't come)<br>
