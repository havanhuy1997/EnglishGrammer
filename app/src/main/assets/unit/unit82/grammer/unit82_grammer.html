We use myself/yourself/himself etc. (reflexive pronouns)<br>
We use myself/yourself/himself etc. (reflexive pronouns) when the subject and object are the same:<br>
subject -> (George) cut (himself). <- object<br>
The reflexive pronouns are:<br>
singular: myself yourself (one person) himself/herself/itself<br>
plural: ourselves yourselves (more than one person) themselves<br>

* Do you sometimes talk to yourself? (said to one person)<br>
* If you want more to eat, help yourselves. (said to more than one person)<br>
Compare:<br>
* It's not our fault. You can't blame us.<br>
* It's our own fault. We blame ourselves.<br>
Note that we do not use myself/yourself etc. after 'bring/take something with ...':<br>
