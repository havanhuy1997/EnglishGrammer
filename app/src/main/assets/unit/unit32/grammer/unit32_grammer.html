    'You must do something' = it is necessary that you do it:<br>
* Don't tell anybody what I said. You must keep it a secret.<br>
* We haven't got much time. We must hurry.<br>
'You mustn't do something' = it is necessary that you do not do it (so don't do it):<br>
* You must keep it a secret. You mustn't tell anybody else. (= don't tell anybody else)<br>
* It's essential that nobody hears us. We mustn't make any noise.<br>
'You needn't do something' = it is not necessary that you do it, you don't need to do it:<br>
* You can come with me if you like but you needn't come if you don't want to. (= it is not necessary for you to come)<br>
* We've got plenty of time. We needn't hurry. (= it is not necessary to hurry)<br>

<div class="sec">
	<div class="section"> <B>B</B> <br>Instead of needn't, you can use don't/doesn't need to. So you can say:</div><br>
    * We needn't hurry. or We don't need to hurry.<br>
Remember that we say 'don't need to do', but 'needn't do' (without to).<br>
Needn't and don't need to are similar to don't have to (see Unit 31C):<br>
* We've got plenty of time. We don't have to hurry.<br>

<div class="sec">
	<div class="section"> <B>C</B> <br>Needn't have (done)</div><br>
    Study this example situation:<br>
I think it's going to rain. I'll take the umbrella.<br>
I needn't have brought the umbrella.<br>
George had to go out. He thought it was going to rain, so he decided to take the umbrella.<br>
But it didn't rain, so the umbrella was not necessary. So:<br>
He needn't have taken the umbrella.<br>
'He needn't have taken the umbrella' = He took the umbrella but this was not necessary. Of course, he<br>
didn't know this when he went out.<br>
Compare needn't (do) and needn't have (done):<br>
* That shirt isn't dirty. You needn't wash it.<br>
* Why did you wash that shirt? It wasn't dirty. You needn't have washed it.<br>

</div>


<div class="sec">
	<div class="section"> <B>D</B> <br>Didn't need to (do) and needn't have (done)</div><br>
    I didn't need to ... = it was not necessary for me to... (and I knew this at the time):<br>
* I didn't need to get up early, so I didn't.<br>
* I didn't need to get up early, but it was a lovely morning, so I did.<br>
'I needn't have (done) something' = I did something but now I know that it was not necessary:<br>
* I got up very early because I had to get ready to go away. But in fact it didn't take me long to get ready.<br>
So, I needn't have got up so early. I could have stayed in bed longer.<br>
