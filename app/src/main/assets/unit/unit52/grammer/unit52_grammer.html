<div class="sec">
	<div class="section"> <B>A</B> <br>Look at these examples:</div><br>
    * I enjoy dancing. (not 'I enjoy to dance')<br>
* Would you mind closing the door? (not 'mind to close')<br>
* Ian suggested going to the cinema. (not 'suggested to go')<br>
After enjoy, mind and suggest, we use ~ing (not to ...).<br>

stop delay fancy consider admit miss involve finish postpone imagine avoid deny risk practise<br>
* Suddenly everybody stopped talking. There was silence.<br>
* I'll do the shopping when I've finished cleaning the flat.<br>
* He tried to avoid answering my question.<br>
* I don't fancy going out this evening.<br>
* Have you ever considered going to live in another country?<br>
Note the negative form not ~ing:<br>
* When I'm on holiday, I enjoy not having to get up early.<br>

</div>


<div class="sec">
	<div class="section"> <B>B</B> <br>We also use ~ing after:</div><br>
    give up (= stop)<br>
put off (= postpone)<br>
carry on/go on (= continue)<br>
keep or keep on (= do something continuously or repeatedly)<br>
* Paula has given up smoking.<br>
* We must do something. We can't go on living like this! (or ... carry on living ...)<br>
* Don't keep interrupting me while I'm speaking. (or Don't keep on interrupting ...)<br>

</div>


<div class="sec">
	<div class="section"> <B>C</B> <br>With some verbs you can use the structure verb + somebody + ~ing-</div><br>
    * I can't imagine George riding a motorbike.<br>
* You can't stop me doing what I want.<br>
* 'Sorry to keep you waiting so long.' 'That's all right.'<br>
Note the passive form (being done/seen/kept etc.):<br>
* I don't mind being kept waiting. (= I don't mind people keeping me ...)<br>

</div>


<div class="sec">
	<div class="section"> <B>D</B> <br>When you are talking about finished actions, you can say having done/stolen/said etc.:</div><br>
    * She admitted having stolen the money.<br>
But it is not necessary to use having (done). You can also use the simple ~ing form for finished actions:<br>
* She admitted stealing the money.<br>
* I now regret saying (or having said) what I said.<br>
For regret, see Unit 55B.<br>
