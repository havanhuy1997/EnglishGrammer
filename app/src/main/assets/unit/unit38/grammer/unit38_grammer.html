	<div class="section"> <B>A</B> <br>Study this example situation:</div><br>
    Sue wants to phone Paul but she can't do this because she doesn't know his number. She says:<br>
If I knew his number, I would phone him.<br>
Sue says: If I knew his number... . This tells us that she doesn't know his number.<br>
She is imagining the situation. The real situation is that she doesn't know his number.<br>
When you imagine a situation like this, you use if + past (if I knew/if you were/if we didn't etc.). But the meaning is present, not past:<br>
* Tom would read more if he had more time. (but he doesn't have much time)<br>
* If I didn't want to go to the party, I wouldn't go. (but I want to go)<br>
* We wouldn't have any money if we didn't work. (but we work)<br>
* If you were in my position, what would you do?<br>
* It's a pity you can't drive. It would be useful if you could.<br>

</div>


<div class="sec">
	<div class="section"> <B>B</B> <br>We use the past in the same way after wish (I wish I knew/I wish you were etc.). We use wish to say that we regret something, that something is not as we would like it to be:</div><br>
    * I wish I knew Paul's phone number. (= I don't know it and I regret this)<br>
* Do you ever wish you could fly? (you can't fly)<br>
* It rains a lot here. I wish it didn't rain so Often.<br>
* It's very crowded here. I wish there weren't so many people. (but there are a lot of people)<br>
* I wish I didn't have to work. (but I have to work)<br>

</div>


<div class="sec">
	<div class="section"> <B>C</B> <br>After if and wish, you can use were instead of was (if I were I wish it were etc.). So you can say:</div><br>
    * If I were you, I wouldn't buy that coat. or If I was you...<br>
* I'd go out if it weren't raining. or if it wasn't raining.<br>
* I wish it were possible. or I wish it was possible.<br>

</div>


<div class="sec">
	<div class="section"> <B>D</B> <br>We do not normally use would in the if-part of the sentence or after wish:</div><br>
    * If I were rich, I would have a yacht. (not 'If I would be rich')<br>
* I wish I had something to read. (not 'I wish I would have')<br>
Sometimes wish ... would is possible ('I wish you would listen'). See Unit 40C.<br>

</div>


<div class="sec">
	<div class="section"> <B>E</B> <br>Note that could sometimes means 'would be able to' and sometimes 'was/were able to':</div><br>
    * You could get a job more easily. (you could get = you would be able to get)<br>
if you could speak a foreign language. (you could speak = you were able to speak)<br>
