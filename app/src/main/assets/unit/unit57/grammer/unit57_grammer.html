    These verbs and expressions all mean 'like' or 'not like'. They are often followed by ~ing:<br>
* Ann hates flying.<br>
* Why do you dislike living here?<br>
* I don't like people shouting at me. (= I don't like being shouted at.)<br>
After love, hate and can't bear, you can also use to ... So you can say:<br>
* I love meeting people. or I love to meet people.<br>
* She can't bear being alone. or She can't bear to be alone.<br>
But after enjoy/dislike/mind/can't stand, we use only ~ing (not 'to ...'):<br>
* I enjoy being alone. (not 'I enjoy to be')<br>
* Tom doesn't mind working at night. (not 'mind to work')<br>

</div>


<div class="sec">
	<div class="section"> <B>B</B> <br>Like</div><br>
    You can say 'I like doing something' or 'I like to do something'. Often it doesn't matter which you use, so you can say:<br>
* I like getting up early. or I like to get up early.<br>
In British English, there is sometimes a difference between 'I like doing' and 'I like to do'.<br>
'I like doing something' means 'I enjoy it':<br>
* Do you like cooking? (= do you enjoy it?)<br>
* I like living here. (= I enjoy it)<br>
'I like to do something' means 'I think it is good or right +() do it':<br>
* I like to clean the kitchen as often as possible. (This doesn't mean that I enjoy it; it means that I think it is a good thing to do.)<br>
* Mary likes people to be on time.<br>

</div>


<div class="sec">
	<div class="section"> <B>C</B> <br>Would like/would love/would hate/would prefer are usually followed by to ... (infinitive):</div><br>
    * I would like to be rich.<br>
* Would you like to come to dinner on Friday?<br>
* I'd love (= would love) to be able to travel round the world.<br>
* Would you prefer to have dinner now or later?<br>
Compare I like and I would like:<br>
* I like playing/to play tennis. (= I enjoy it in general)<br>
* I would like to play tennis today. (= I want to play today)<br>
Note that would mind is followed by ~ing (not to ...)<br>
* Would you mind closing the door, please?<br>

</div>


<div class="sec">
	<div class="section"> <B>D</B> <br>You can also say 'I would like to have done something' (= I regret now that I didn't or couldn't do something):</div><br>
    * It's a pity we didn't see Val when we were in London. I would like to have seen her again.<br>
* We'd like to have gone on holiday but we didn't have enough money.<br>
You can use the same structure after would love/would hate/would prefer:<br>
* Poor old Tom! I would hate to have been in his position.<br>
* I'd love to have gone to the party but it was impossible.<br>
