	<div class="section"> <B>A</B> <br>Study this example situation:</div><br>
    Shirley, Henry and Arthur are all millionaires. They are all very rich.<br>
Shirley has 10 million pounds, Henry has 8 million pounds and Arthur has 2 million pounds. So:<br>
Henry is rich.<br>
He is richer than Arthur.<br>
But he isn't as rich as Shirley. (= Shirley is richer than he is)<br>
Some more examples of not as ... (as):<br>
* Tom isn't as old as he looks. (= he looks older than he is)<br>
* The city centre wasn't as crowded this morning as it usually is. (= it is usually more crowded)<br>
* jenny didn't do as well in the exam as she had hoped. (= she had hoped to do better)<br>
* 'The weather is better today, isn't it?' 'Yes, it's not as cold.' (= yesterday was colder)<br>
* I don't know as many people as you do. (= you know more people)<br>
You can also say 'not so. (as)':<br>
* It's not warm but it isn't so cold as yesterday. (= ... it isn't as cold as ...)<br>
Less ... (than) is similar to not as ... (as):<br>
* I spent less money than you. (= I didn't spend as much money ...)<br>
* The city centre was less crowded than usual. (= it wasn't as crowded ...)<br>

</div>


<div class="sec">
	<div class="section"> <B>B</B> <br>You can use as ... as (but not 'so ... as') in positive sentences and in questions:</div><br>
    * I'm sorry I'm late. I got here as fast as I could.<br>
* There's plenty of food. You can have as much as you like.<br>
* Let's walk. It's just as quick as taking the bus.<br>
* Can you send me the money as soon as possible, please?<br>
Also: twice as ... as, three times as ... as etc.:<br>
* Petrol is twice as expensive as it was a few years ago.<br>
* Their house is about three times as big as ours.<br>

</div>


<div class="sec">
	<div class="section"> <B>C</B> <br>We say the same as (not 'the same like'):</div><br>
    * Ann's salary is the same as mine. or Ann gets the same salary as me.<br>
* Tom is the same age as George.<br>
* 'What would you like to drink?' 'I'll have the same as you.'<br>

</div>


<div class="sec">
	<div class="section"> <B>D</B> <br>Than me/than I am etc.</div><br>
    We usually say:<br>
* You are taller than me. (not 'than I')<br>
* He is not as clever as her. (not 'as she')<br>
After than/as it is more usual to say me/him/her/them/us when there is no verb. Compare:<br>
* You are taller than I am. but You are taller than me.<br>
* They have more money than we have. but They have more money than us.<br>
* I can't run as fast as he can. but I can't run as fast as him.<br>
