	<div class="section"> <B>A</B> <br>Do not use the present perfect (I have done) when you talk about a finished time (for example, yesterday/ten minutes ago/in 1985/when I was a child). Use a past tense:</div><br>
    * The weather was nice yesterday. (not 'has been nice')<br>
* They arrived ten minutes ago. (not 'have arrived')<br>
* I ate a lot of sweets when I was a child. (not 'have eaten')<br>
* A: Did you see the news on television last night? (not 'Have you seen')<br>
B: No, I went to bed early. (not 'have gone')<br>
Use a past tense to ask When ...? or What time ...?:<br>
* When did they arrive? (not 'have they arrived')<br>
* What time did you finish work?<br>
Compare:<br>
Present perfect<br>
* Tom has lost his key. He can't get into the house.<br>
Here, we are not thinking of the past action. We are thinking of the present result of the action: Tom doesn't have his key now.<br>
Past simple<br>
* Tom lost his key yesterday. He couldn't get into the house.<br>
Here, we are thinking of the action in the past. We don't know from this sentence whether Tom has his key now.<br>

	<div class="section"> <B>B</B> <br>Compare present perfect and past:</div><br>
    Present perfect (have done)<br>
* I've done a lot of work today.<br>
We use the present perfect for a period of time that continues from the past until now. For example, today, this week, since 1985.<br>
* It hasn't rained this week.<br>
* Have you seen Ann this morning? (it is still morning)<br>
* Have you seen Ann recently?<br>
* I don't know where Ann is. I haven't seen her. (= I haven't seen her recently)<br>
* We've been waiting for an hour. (we are still waiting now)<br>
* Ian lives in London. He has lived there for seven years.<br>
* I have never played golf. (in my life)<br>
The present perfect always has a connection with now. See Units 7-12.<br>
Past simple (did)<br>
* I did a lot of work yesterday.<br>
We use the past simple for a finished time in the past. For example, yesterday, last week, from 1985 to 1991.<br>
* It didn't rain last week.<br>
* Did you see Ann this morning? (it is now afternoon or evening)<br>
* Did you see Ann on Sunday?<br>
* A: Was Ann at the party on Sunday?<br>
B: I don't think so. I didn't see her.<br>
* We waited (or were waiting) for an hour. (we are no longer waiting)<br>
* Ian lived in Scotland for ten years.<br>
Now he lives in London.<br>
* I didn't play golf when I was on holiday last summer.<br>
The past simple tells us only about the past. See Units 5-6.<br>
