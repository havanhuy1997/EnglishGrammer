    Good is an adjective. The adverb is well:<br>
* Your English is good. but You speak English well.<br>
* Susan is a good pianist. but Susan plays the piano well.<br>
We use well (not 'good') with past participles (dressed/known etc.):<br>
well-dressed well-known well-educated well-paid<br>
But well is also an adjective with the meaning 'in good health':<br>
* 'How are you today?', 'I'm very well, thanks.' (not 'I'm very good')<br>
