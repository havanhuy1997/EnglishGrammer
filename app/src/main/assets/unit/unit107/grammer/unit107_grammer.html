words. (The rules are the same as those for the comparative - see Unit 104.) long -> longest, hot -> hottest, easy -> easiest, hard -> hardest but most famous, most boring most difficult, most expensive<br>
These adjectives are irregular:<br>

<div class="sec">

* This hotel is cheaper than all the others in town. (comparative)<br>

</div>


<div class="sec">
	<div class="section"> <B>D</B> <br>Oldest and eldest</div><br>
    The superlative of old is oldest:<br>
* That church is the oldest building in the town. (not 'the eldest')<br>
We use eldest (or oldest) when we are talking about people in a family:<br>
* My eldest son is 13 years old. (or My oldest son . )<br>
* Are you the eldest in your family? (or . the oldest.<br>

</div>


<div class="sec">
