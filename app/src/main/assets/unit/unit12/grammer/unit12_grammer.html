<div class="sec">
	<div class="section"> <B>B</B> <br>We use both for and since to say how long something has been happening.</div><br>
    We use for when we say a period of time (two hours, six weeks etc.):<br>
* I've been waiting for two hours.<br>
for two hours<br>
two hours ago -> now<br>
two hours/a week/20 minutes/50 years/five days/a long time/six months/ages<br>
* Sally's been working here for six months. (not 'since six months')<br>
* I haven't seen Tom for three days. (not 'since three days')<br>
We use since when we say the start of a period (8 o'clock, Monday, 1985 etc.):<br>
* I've been waiting since 8 o'clock.<br>
since 8 o'clock<br>
8 o'clock -> now<br>
since<br>
8 o'clock/1977/Monday/Christmas/12 May/lunchtime/April/they were at school<br>
* Sally's been working here since April. (= from April until now)<br>
* I haven't seen Tom since Monday. (= from Monday until now)<br>
It is possible to leave out for (but not usually in negative sentences):<br>
* They've been married (for) ten years. (with or without for)<br>
* They haven't had a holiday for ten years. (you must use for)<br>
We do not use for + all ... (all day/all my life etc.):<br>
* I've lived here all my life. (not 'for all my life')<br>

</div>


<div class="sec">
	<div class="section"> <B>C</B> <br>We say 'It's (a long time/two years etc.) since something happened':</div><br>
    * It's two years since I last saw Joe. (= I haven't seen Joe for two years/the last time I saw Joe was two<br>
years ago)<br>
* It's ages since we went to the cinema. (= We haven't been to the cinema for ages)<br>
The question is How long is it since ...?<br>
