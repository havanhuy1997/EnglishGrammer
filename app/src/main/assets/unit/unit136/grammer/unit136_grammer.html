So you can say put out/get on/take off/run away etc. These verbs are phrasal verbs. We often use out/off/up etc. with verbs of movement. For example:<br>
get on: * The bus was full. We couldn't get on.<br>
drive off: * A woman got into the car and drove off.<br>
come back: * Sally is leaving tomorrow and coming back on Saturday.<br>
turn round: * When I touched him on the shoulder, he turned round.<br>
But often the second word (out/off/up etc.) gives a special meaning to the verb. For example:<br>
break down: * Sorry I'm late. The car broke down. (= the engine stopped working)<br>
look out: * Look out! There's a car coming. (= be careful)<br>
take off: * It was my first flight. I was nervous as the plane took off. (= went into the air)<br>
get up: * I was very tired this morning. I couldn't get up. (= get out of bed)<br>
get on: * How was the exam? How did you get on? (= how did you do?)<br>
get by: * My French isn't very good but it's enough to get by. (= to manage)<br>

	<div class="section"> <B>B</B> <br>Sometimes a phrasal verb is followed by a preposition. For example:</div><br>
    * Why did you run away from me?<br>
* You're walking too fast. I can't keep up with you.<br>
* Are you looking forward to your holiday?<br>
* Jack is trying to cut down on smoking. (=reduce smoking)<br>

    C. Sometimes a phrasal verb has an object. Usually there are two possible positions for the object. So you can say:<br>
I turned off _the light._(object) or I turned the light off.<br>
If the object is a pronoun (it/them/me/him etc.), only one position is possible:<br>
I turned it off. (not 'I turned off it')<br>
Some more examples:<br>
* Could you fill in this form?<br>
* Could you fill this form in?<br>
but They gave me a form and told me to fill it in. (not 'fill in it')<br>
* The police got into the house by breaking down the door.<br>
* The police got into the house by breaking the door down.<br>
but The door wasn't locked. Why did the police break it down? (not 'break down it')<br>
* I think I'll throw away these newspapers.<br>
* I think I'll throw these newspapers away.<br>
but Do you want these newspapers or shall I throw them away? (not 'throw away them')<br>
* Don't wake up the baby.<br>
* Don't wake the baby up.<br>
but The baby is asleep. Don't wake her up. (not 'wake up her')<br>
