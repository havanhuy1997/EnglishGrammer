	<div class="section"> <B>A</B> <br>We often use two nouns together (noun + noun) to mean one thing/person/idea etc. For example:</div><br>
    a tennis ball a bank manager a road accident income tax the city centre<br>
The first noun is like an adjective--it tells us what kind of thing/person/idea etc. For example:<br>
a tennis ball = a ball used to play tennis<br>
a tennis ball = a ball used to play tennis a road accident = an accident that happens on the road<br>
a tennis ball = a ball used to play tennis a road accident = an accident that happens on the road income tax = tax that you pay on your income<br>
a tennis ball = a ball used to play tennis a road accident = an accident that happens on the road income tax = tax that you pay on your income the sea temperature = the temperature of the sea<br>
a tennis ball = a ball used to play tennis a road accident = an accident that happens on the road income tax = tax that you pay on your income the sea temperature = the temperature of the sea a London doctor = a doctor from London<br>
So you can say:<br>
a television camera a television programme a television studio a television producer<br>
(all different things or people to do with television)<br>
(all different things or people to do with television) language problems marriage problems health problems work problems<br>
(all different kinds of problems)<br>
Compare:<br>
garden vegetables (= vegetables that are grown in a garden)<br>
garden vegetables (= vegetables that are grown in a garden) a vegetable garden (= a garden where vegetables are grown)<br>
Often the first word ends in ~ing. Usually these are things used for doing something. For example:<br>
a washing machine a frying pan a swimming pool the dining room<br>
Sometimes there are more than two nouns together:<br>
* I waited at the hotel reception desk. (= a desk)<br>
* We watched the World Swimming Championships on television.<br>
* If you want to play table tennis (= a game), you need a table tennis table (= a table).<br>

    B. When nouns are together like this, sometimes we write them as one word and sometimes as two separate words. For example:<br>
a headache toothpaste a weekend a stomach ache table tennis<br>
There are no clear rules for this. If you are not sure, it is usually better to write two words.<br>
You can often put a hyphen (-) between the two words (but this is not usually necessary): a dining-room<br>
the city-centre<br>

<div class="sec">
	<div class="section"> <B>C</B> <br>Note the difference between:</div><br>
    a wine glass (perhaps empty) and a glass of wine (= a glass with wine in it)<br>
a wine glass (perhaps empty) and a glass of wine (= a glass with wine in it) a shopping bag (perhaps empty) and a bag of shopping (= a bag full of shopping)<br>

In the same way we say:<br>
a three-hour journey (not 'a three-hours journey')<br>
a three-hour journey (not 'a three-hours journey') a ten-pound note (not 'pounds') two 14-year-old girls (not 'years')<br>
a three-hour journey (not 'a three-hours journey') a ten-pound note (not 'pounds') two 14-year-old girls (not 'years') a four-week English course (not 'weeks') a three-page letter (not 'pages')<br>
So we say:<br>
* It was a three-hour journey. but The journey took three hours.<br>
