<div class="sec">
	<div class="section"> <B>A</B> <br>Look at these examples:</div><br>
    How shall we travel? By car or by train?<br>
Let's go by car. It's cheaper.<br>
Don't go by train. It's more expensive.<br>
Cheaper and more expensive are comparative forms.<br>
After comparatives you can use than (see also Unit 106):<br>
* It's cheaper to go by car than by train.<br>
* Going by train is more expensive than going by car.<br>

</div>


<div class="sec">
	<div class="section"> <B>B</B> <br>The comparative form is ~er or more ...</div><br>
    We use ~er for short words (one syllable):<br>
cheap -> cheaper, fast-> faster, large -> larger, thin -> thinner<br>
We also use ~er for two-syllable words that end in -y (-y -> -ier):<br>
lucky -> luckier, early -> earlier, easy -> easier, pretty -> prettier<br>
For spelling, see Appendix 6.<br>
Compare these examples:<br>
* You're older than me.<br>
* The exam was quite easy - easier than we expected.<br>
* Can you walk a bit faster?<br>
* I'd like to have a bigger car.<br>
* Last night I went to bed earlier than usual.<br>
We use more... for longer words (two syllables or more):<br>
more modern, more serious, more expensive, more comfortable<br>
We use more... for adverbs that end in -1y:<br>
more slowly, more seriously, more quietly, more carefully<br>
Also: more often<br>
but: earlier (not 'more early')<br>
* You're more patient than me.<br>
* The exam was quite difficult - more difficult than we expected.<br>
* Can you walk a bit more slowly?<br>
* I'd like to have a more reliable car.<br>
* 1 don't play tennis much these days. I used to play more often.<br>
You can use ~er or more... with some two-syllable adjectives, especially:<br>
quiet, clever, narrow, shallow, simple<br>
* It's too noisy here. Can we go somewhere quieter/more quiet?<br>

</div>


<div class="sec">
	<div class="section"> <B>C</B> <br>These adjectives and adverbs have irregular comparative forms:</div><br>
    good/well -> better:<br>
* The garden looks better since you tidied it up.<br>
* I know him well - probably better than anybody else.<br>
bad/badly -> worse:<br>
* 'Is your headache better?' 'No, it's worse.'<br>
* He did very badly in the exam - worse than expected.<br>
far --> further (or farther):<br>
* It's a long walk from here to the station - further than I thought.(or ...farther than...) Further (but not 'farther')<br>
can also mean 'more' or 'additional':<br>
* Let me know if you hear any further news. (= any more news)<br>
