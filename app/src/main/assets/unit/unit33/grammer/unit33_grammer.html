<div class="sec">
	<div class="section"> <B>A</B> <br>You should do something = it Is a good thing to do or the right thing to do. You can use should to give advice or to give an opinion:</div><br>
    * You look tired. You should go to bed.<br>
* The government should do more to help homeless people.<br>
* 'Should we invite Susan to the party?' 'Yes, I think we should.'<br>
We often use should with I think/I don't think/Do you think...?:<br>
* I think the government should do more to help homeless people.<br>
* I don't think you should work so hard.<br>
* 'Do you think I should apply for this job?' 'Yes, I think you should.'<br>
'You shouldn't do something' = it isn't a good thing to do:<br>
* You shouldn't believe everything you read in the newspapers.<br>
Should is not as strong as must:<br>
* You should apologise. (= it would be a good thing to do)<br>
* You must apologise. (= you have no alternative)<br>

</div>


<div class="sec">
	<div class="section"> <B>B</B> <br>We also use should when something is not right or what we expect. For example:</div><br>
    * I wonder where Liz is. She should be here by now. (= she isn't here yet, and this is not normal)<br>
* The price on this packet is wrong. It should be L1.20, not L1.50.<br>
* Those boys shouldn't be playing football at this time. They should be at school.<br>
We use should to say that we expect something to happen:<br>
* She's been studying hard for the exam, so she should pass. (= I expect her to pass)<br>
* There are plenty of hotels in the town. It shouldn't be difficult to find somewhere to stay. (= I don't expect that it will be difficult)<br>

</div>


<div class="sec">
	<div class="section"> <B>C</B> <br>'You should have done something' = you didn't do it but it would have been the right thing to do:</div><br>
    * It was a great party last night. You should have come. Why didn't you? (= you didn't come but it would have been good to come)<br>
* I'm feeling sick. I shouldn't have eaten so much chocolate. (= I ate too much chocolate)<br>
* I wonder why they're so late. They should have been here an hour ago.<br>
* She shouldn't have been listening to our conversation. It was private.<br>
Compare should (do) and should have (done):<br>
* You look tired. You should go to bed now.<br>
* You went to bed very late last night. You should have gone to bed earlier.<br>

</div>


<div class="sec">
	<div class="section"> <B>D</B> <br>Ought to ...</div><br>
    You can use ought to instead of should in the sentences on this page. Note that we say 'ought to do...' (with to):<br>
* Do you think I ought to apply for this job? (= Do you think I should apply ...?)<br>
* Jack ought not to go to bed so late. (= Jack shouldn't go ...)<br>
* It was a great party last night. You ought to have come.<br>
* She's been studying hard for the exam, so she ought to pass<br>
