<div class="sec">
	<div class="section"> <B>A</B> <br>When one verb follows another verb, the structure is usually verb + ~ing or verb + to ... Compare:</div><br>
    verb + ~ing<br>
* They denied stealing the money.<br>
* I enjoy going out.<br>
Often we use ~ing for an action that happens before the first verb or at the same time:<br>
stealing <- denied<br>
verb + to ...<br>
* They decided to steal the money.<br>
* I want to go out.<br>
Often we use to... for an action that follows the first verb:<br>
decided -> to steal want -> to go<br>
This difference is often helpful (see Section B) but does not explain all uses of ~ing and to...<br>

</div>


<div class="sec">
	<div class="section"> <B>B</B> <br>Some verbs can be followed by ~ing or to... with a difference of meaning:</div><br>
    remember<br>
I remember doing something = I did it and now I remember this.<br>
You remember doing something after you have done it:<br>
* I'm absolutely sure I locked the door. I clearly remember locking it. (= I locked it, and now I remember<br>
this)<br>
* He could remember driving along the road just before the accident happened, but he couldn't remember<br>
the accident itself.<br>
I remembered to do something = I remembered that I had to do it, and so I did it.<br>
You remember to do something before you do it:<br>
* I remembered to lock the door when I left but I forgot to shut the windows. (= I remembered that I had to<br>
lock the door and so I locked it)<br>
* Please remember to post the letter. (= don't forget to post it)<br>
regret<br>
I regret doing something = I did it and now I'm sorry about it:<br>
* I now regret saying what I said. I shouldn't have said it.<br>
I regret to say/to tell you/to inform you = I'm sorry that I have to say (etc.):<br>
* (from a formal letter) We regret to inform you that we are unable to offer you the job.<br>
go on<br>
Go on doing something = continue doing the same thing:<br>
* The minister went on talking for two hours.<br>
* We must change our ways. We can't go on living like this.<br>
Go on to do something = do or say something new:<br>
* After discussing the economy, the minister then went on to talk about foreign policy.<br>

</div>


<div class="sec">
	<div class="section"> <B>C</B> <br>begin start intend continue bother</div><br>
    These verbs can be followed by ~ing or to... with little or no difference in meaning. So you can say:<br>
* It has started raining. or It has started to rain.<br>
* John intends buying a house. or John intends to buy ...<br>
* Don't bother locking the door. or Don't bother to lock ...<br>
But normally we do not use ~ing after ~ing:<br>
* It's starting to rain. (not 'it's starting raining')<br>
