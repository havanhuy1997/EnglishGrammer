	<div class="section"> <B>A</B> <br>Study this example situation:</div><br>
    You are looking for Bob. Nobody is sure where he is but you get some suggestions.<br>
You: Where's Bob?<br>
He may be in his office. (= perhaps he is in his office)<br>
He might be having lunch. (= perhaps he is having lunch)<br>
Ask Ann. She might know. (= perhaps she knows)<br>
We use may or might to say that something is a possibility. Usually you can use may or might you can say:<br>
* It may be true. or It might be true. (= perhaps it is true)<br>
* She might know. or She may know.<br>
The negative forms are may not and might not (or mightn't):<br>
* It might not be true. (= perhaps it isn't true)<br>
* I'm not sure whether I can lend you any money. I may not have enough. (= perhaps I don't have enough)<br>
Study the structure:<br>
I/you/he (etc.) may/might (not) be (true/in his office etc.)<br>
I/you/he (etc.) may/might (not) be (doing/working/having etc.)<br>
I/you/he (etc.) may/might (not) do/know/have/want etc.<br>

<div class="sec">
	<div class="section"> <B>B</B> <br>For the past we use may have (done) or might have (done):</div><br>
    * A: I wonder why Kay didn't answer the phone.<br>
B: She may have been asleep. (= perhaps she was asleep)<br>
* A: I can't find my bag anywhere.<br>
B: You might have left it in the shop. (= perhaps you left it in the shop)<br>
* A: I was surprised that Sarah wasn't at the meeting.<br>
B: She might not have known about it. (= perhaps she didn't know)<br>
* A: I wonder why Colin was in such a bad mood yesterday.<br>
B: He may not have been feeling well. (= perhaps he wasn't feeling well)<br>
Study the structure:<br>
I/you/he (etc.) may/might (not) have been (asleep/at home etc.)<br>
I/you/he (etc.) may/might (not) have been (doing/waiting etc.)<br>
I/you/he (etc.) may/might (not) have done/known/had/seen etc.<br>

<div class="sec">
	<div class="section"> <B>C</B> <br>Sometimes could has a similar meaning to may and might:</div><br>
    * The phone's ringing. It could be Tim. (= it may/might be Tim)<br>
* You could have left your bag in the shop. (= you may/might have left it...)<br>
But couldn't (negative) is different from may not and might not. Compare:<br>
* She was too far away, so she couldn't have seen you. (= it is not possible that she saw you)<br>
* A: I wonder why she didn't say hello.<br>
B: She might not have seen you. (= perhaps she didn't see you; perhaps she did)<br>
