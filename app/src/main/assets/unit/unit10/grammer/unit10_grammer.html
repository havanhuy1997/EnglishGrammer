	<div class="section"> <B>A</B> <br>Study these example situations:</div><br>
    Ann's clothes are covered in paint. She has been painting the ceiling.<br>
Has been Painting is the present perfect<br>
We are interested in the activity. It does not matter whether something has been finished or not. In this example, the activity (painting the ceiling) has not been finished.<br>
The ceiling was white. Now it is blue. She has painted the ceiling.<br>
Has painted is the present perfect simple.<br>
Here, the important thing is that something has been finished. 'Has painted' is a completed action. We are interested in the result of the activity (the painted ceiling), not in the activity itself.<br>
Compare these examples:<br>
* My hands are very dirty. I've been repairing the car. The car is OK again now. I've repaired it.<br>
* She's been smoking too much recently. She should smoke less. Somebody has smoked all my<br>
cigarettes. The packet is empty.<br>
* It's nice to see you again. What have you been doing since we last met? Where's the book I gave you?<br>
What have you done with it?<br>
* Where have you been? Have you been playing tennis? Have you ever played tennis?<br>

</div>


<div class="sec">
	<div class="section"> <B>B</B> <br>We use the continuous to ask or say how long (for an activity that is still happening):</div><br>
    * How long have you been reading that book?<br>
* Mary is still writing letters. She's been writing letters all day.<br>
* They've been playing tennis since 2 o'clock.<br>
We use the simple to ask or say how much, how many or how many times (completed actions):<br>
* How many pages of that book have you read?<br>
* Mary has written ten letters today.<br>
* They've played tennis three times this week.<br>

</div>


<div class="sec">
	<div class="section"> <B>C</B> <br>There are some verbs (for example, know/like/believe) that are normally not used in the continuous:</div><br>
    * I've known about it for a long time. (not 'I've been knowing')<br>
For a list of these verbs, see Unit 4A.<br>
