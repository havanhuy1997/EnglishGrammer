    Try to do = attempt to do, make an effort to do:<br>
* I was very tired. I tried to keep my eyes open but I couldn't.<br>
* Please try to be quiet when you come home. Everyone will be asleep.<br>
Try also means 'do something as an experiment or test'. For example:<br>

* We couldn't find anywhere to stay. We tried every hotel in the town but they were all full. (= we went to every hotel to see if they had a room)<br>
If try (with this meaning) is followed by a verb, we say try ~ing:<br>
* A: The photocopier doesn't seem to be working.<br>
B: Try pressing the green button. (= press the green button - perhaps this will help to solve the problem)<br>
Compare:<br>
* I tried to move the table but it was too heavy. (so I couldn't move it)<br>
* I didn't like the way the furniture was arranged, so I tried moving the table to the other side of the room.<br>
But it still didn't look right, so I moved it back again.<br>

</div>
