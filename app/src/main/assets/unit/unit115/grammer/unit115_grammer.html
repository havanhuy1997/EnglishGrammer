    As sometimes means 'because':<br>
* As it was a public holiday, all the shops were shut. (= because it was a public holiday)<br>
* As they live near us, we see them quite often.<br>
* We watched television all evening as we had nothing better to do. d We also use as to say that two things<br>
* We watched television all evening as we had nothing better to do. d We also use as to say that two things happened at the same time. See Section B.<br>

<div class="sec">
	<div class="section"> <B>B</B> <br>As (time)</div><br>
    You can use as when two things happen at the same time:<br>
* I watched her as she opened the letter. ('I watched' and 'she opened' at the same time)<br>
* As they walked along the street, they looked in the shop windows.<br>
* Can you turn off the light as you go out, please? (= on your way out of the room)<br>
Or you can say that something happened as you were doing something else (= in the middle of doing<br>
Or you can say that something happened as you were doing something else (= in the middle of doing something else):<br>
* Jill slipped as she was getting off the bus.<br>
* The thief was seen as he was climbing over the wall.<br>
Most often we use as when two short actions happen at the same time:<br>
* George arrived as Sue left. (= he arrived and Sue left at the same time)<br>
* We all waved goodbye to Liz as she drove away in her car.<br>
But we also use as when two things happen together over a longer period of time:<br>
* As the day went on, the weather got worse.<br>
* I began to enjoy the job more as I got used to it.<br>
You can also use just as (= exactly at that moment):<br>
* Just as I sat down, the phone rang.<br>
* Just as we were going out, it started to rain.<br>
* I had to leave just as the conversation was getting interesting.<br>
For the past continuous (was getting/were going etc.) see Unit 6.<br>

<div class="sec">
	<div class="section"> <B>C</B> <br>As, when and while</div><br>
    We use as only if two things happen at the same time. We use when (not 'as') if one thing happens after<br>
We use as only if two things happen at the same time. We use when (not 'as') if one thing happens after another. Compare when and as:<br>
* When I got home, I had a bath. (not 'as I got home')<br>
* As I walked into the room, the phone started ringing. (= at the same time)<br>
We use as (time) for actions and happenings. As + a situation (not an action) usually means 'because' (see<br>
Section A):<br>
* As we were asleep, we didn't hear the doorbell. (=because we were asleep)<br>
* As they live near me, I see them quite often. (=because they live near me)<br>
You cannot use as for time in sentences like this. You have to use while or when:<br>
* The doorbell rang while we were asleep. (not 'as we were asleep')<br>
* Angela got married when she was 23. (not 'as she was 23')<br>
