	<div class="section"> <B>A</B> <br>When we ask for information, we often say Do you know ...?/Could you tell me ...? etc. If you begin a question like this, the word order is different from a simple question.</div><br>
    Compare:<br>
Where has Tom gone? (simple question)<br>
but Do you know where Tom has gone? (not 'Do you know where has Tom gone?')<br>
When the question (Where has Tom gone?) is part of a longer sentence (Do you know ...?/I don't<br>
know.../Can you tell me ...? etc.), it loses the normal question word order.<br>
Compare:<br>
* What time is it? but Do you know what time it is?<br>
* Who is that woman? but I don't know who that woman is.<br>
* Where can I find Linda? but Can you tell me where I can find Linda?<br>
* How much will it cost? but Have you any idea how much it will cost?<br>
Be careful with do/does/did questions:<br>
* What time the film begins? but Do you know what time the film begins? (not 'Do you know what time does...')<br>
* What do you mean? but Please explain what you mean.<br>
* Why did Ann leave early? but I wonder why Ann left early.<br>
Use if or whether where there is no other question word (what, why etc.):<br>
* Did anybody see you? but Do you know if (or whether) anybody saw you?<br>

<div class="sec">
	<div class="section"> <B>B</B> <br>The same changes in word order happen in reported questions:</div><br>
    direct: The police officer said to us, "Where are you going?<br>
reported: The police officer asked us where we were-going.<br>
direct: Clare said, 'What time do the bank close?<br>
reported: Clare wanted to know what time the banks closed.<br>
In reported questions, the verb usually changes to the past (were, closed). See Unit 46.<br>
Study these examples. You had an interview for a job and these were some of the questions the interviewer asked you:<br>
INTERVIEWER<br>
How old are you?<br>
What do you do in your spare time?<br>
How long have you been working in your present job?<br>
Why did you apply for the job?<br>
Can you speak any foreign languages?<br>
Have you got a driving licence?<br>
Later you tell a friend what the interviewer asked you. You use reported speech:<br>
* She asked (me) how old I was.<br>
* She wanted to know what I did in my spare time.<br>
* She asked (me) how long I had been working in my present job.<br>
* She asked (me) why I had applied for the job. (or ... why I applied)<br>
* She wanted to know whether (or if) I could speak any foreign languages.<br>
* She asked whether (or if) I had a driving licence. (or ... I had got ... )<br>
