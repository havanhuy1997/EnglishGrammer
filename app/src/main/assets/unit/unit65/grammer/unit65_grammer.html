I am afraid to do something = I don't want to do it because it is dangerous or the result could be bad. We use afraid to do for things we do intentionally:<br>

I am afraid of something happening = it is possible that something bad will happen (for example, an accident). We do not use afraid of ~ing for things we do intentionally:<br>

* The path was icy, so we walked very carefully. We were afraid of falling. (= it was possible that we would fall--not 'we were afraid to fall')<br>
* I don't like dogs. I'm always afraid of being bitten. (not 'afraid to be bitten')<br>
So, you are afraid to do something because you are afraid of something happening as a result:<br>
* I was afraid to go near the dog because I was afraid of being bitten.<br>

<div class="sec">
	<div class="section"> <B>B</B> <br>Interested in (do)ing and interested to (do)</div><br>
    I'm interested in doing something = I'm thinking of doing it, I'd like to do it:<br>
* I'm trying to sell my car but nobody is interested in buying it. (not 'to buy')<br>
We use interested to especially with hear/see/know/read/learn. I was interested to hear it = 'I heard it and it<br>
We use interested to especially with hear/see/know/read/learn. I was interested to hear it = 'I heard it and it was interesting for me':<br>
* I was interested to hear that Diane has got a new job.<br>
* Ask George for his opinion. I would be interested to know what he thinks. (=it would be interesting for me<br>
* Ask George for his opinion. I would be interested to know what he thinks. (=it would be interesting for me to know)<br>
This structure is the same as surprised to/delighted to... etc. (see Unit 64C):<br>
* I was surprised to hear that Diane has got a new job.<br>

</div>


<div class="sec">
	<div class="section"> <B>C</B> <br>Sorry to (do) and sorry for (do)ing</div><br>
    We usually say sorry to... to apologize when (or just before) we do something:<br>
* I'm sorry to bother you, but I need to talk to you.<br>
We use sorry to (hear/read etc.) to show sympathy with somebody (see Unit 64C):<br>
* I was sorry to hear that Fiona lost her job. (= I was sorry when I heard ...)<br>
You can use sorry for (doing something) to apologize for something you did before:<br>
* (I'm) sorry for shouting at you yesterday. (not 'Sorry to shout ...')<br>
You can also say:<br>
* (I'm) sorry I shouted at you yesterday.<br>

</div>


<div class="sec">
	<div class="section"> <B>D</B> <br>Note that we say:</div><br>
    I want to (do)/I'd like to (do) but I'm thinking of (do)ing/I dream of (do)ing<br>
I failed to (do) but I succeeded in (do)ing<br>
I allowed them to (do) but I prevented them from (do)ing<br>
