<div class="sec">
	<div class="section"> <B>A</B> <br>We use the ... when there is only one of something:</div><br>
    * What is the longest river in the world? (there is only one longest river)<br>
* The earth goes round the sun and the moon goes round the earth.<br>
* I'm going away at the end of this month.<br>
Don't forget the:<br>
* Paris is the capital of France. (not 'Paris is capital of...')<br>
But we use a/an to say what kind of thing something is (see Unit 70C). Compare the and a:<br>
* The sun is a star. (= one of many stars)<br>
* The hotel we stayed at was a very nice hotel.<br>

</div>


<div class="sec">
	<div class="section"> <B>B</B> <br>We say: the sky the sea the ground the country the environment:</div><br>
    * We looked up at all the stars in the sky. (not 'in sky')<br>
* Would you rather live in a town or in the country?<br>
* We must do more to protect the environment. (= the natural world around us)<br>
Note that we say space (without 'the') when we mean 'space in the universe':<br>
* There are millions of stars in space. (not 'in the space')<br>
* There are millions of stars in space. (not 'in the space') but * I tried to park my car but the space was too small.<br>

</div>


<div class="sec">
	<div class="section"> <B>C</B> <br>We use the before same (the same):</div><br>
    * Your pullover is the same colour as mine. (not 'is same colour')<br>
* These two photographs are the same. (not 'are same')<br>

</div>


<div class="sec">
	<div class="section"> <B>D</B> <br>We say: (go to) the cinema, the theatre:</div><br>
    * I often go to the cinema but I haven't been to the theatre for ages.<br>
When we say the cinema/the theatre, we do not necessarily mean one particular cinema or theatre.<br>
We usually say the radio, but television (without 'the'):<br>
* I often listen to the radio.<br>
* We heard the news on the radio.<br>
* I often watch television.<br>
* We watched the news on television.<br>
but * Can you turn off the television, please? (= the television set)<br>
Compare a:<br>
* There isn't a theatre in this town.<br>
* I'm going to buy a new radio/television (set).<br>

</div>


<div class="sec">
	<div class="section"> <B>E</B> <br>Breakfast lunch dinner</div><br>
    We do not normally use the with the names of meals (breakfast, lunch etc.):<br>
* What did you have for breakfast?<br>
* We had lunch in a very nice restaurant.<br>
* What time is dinner?<br>
But we use a if there is an adjective before breakfast, lunch etc.:<br>
We had a very nice lunch. (not 'we had very nice lunch')<br>

</div>


<div class="sec">
	<div class="section"> <B>F</B> <br>Platform 5 Room 126 etc.</div><br>
    We do not use 'the' before noun + number. For example, we say:<br>
* Our train leaves from Platform 5. (not 'the Platform 5')<br>
* (in a shop) Have you got these shoes in size 43? (not 'the size 43')<br>
In the same way, we say: Room 126 (in a hotel) page 29 (of a book) Section A etc.<br>
