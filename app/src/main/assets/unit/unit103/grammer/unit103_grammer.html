	<div class="section"> <B>A</B> <br>Quite = less than 'very' but more than 'a little':</div><br>
    * I'm surprised you haven't heard of her. She's quite famous. (= less than 'very famous' but more than 'a<br>
* I'm surprised you haven't heard of her. She's quite famous. (= less than 'very famous' but more than 'a little famous')<br>
* It's quite cold. You'd better wear your coat.<br>
* Lucy lives quite near me, so we see each other quite often.<br>
Quite goes before a/an:<br>
quite a nice day (not 'a quite nice day'), quite an old house, quite a long way<br>
Sometimes we use quite + noun (without an adjective):<br>
* I didn't expect to see them. It was quite a surprise.<br>
We also use quite with some verbs, especially like and enjoy:<br>
* I quite like tennis but it's not my favourite sport.<br>
Quite sometimes means 'completely'. See Section C.<br>

<div class="sec">
	<div class="section"> <B>B</B> <br>Rather is similar to quite. We use rather mainly with negative words and negative ideas:</div><br>
    * It's rather cold. You'd better wear your coat.<br>
* 'What was the examination like?' 'Rather difficult, I'm afraid.'<br>
* Let's get a taxi. It's rather a long way to walk.<br>
Quite is also possible in these examples.<br>
Often we use quite with a positive idea and rather with a negative idea:<br>
* She's quite intelligent but rather lazy.<br>
When we use rather with positive words (nice/interesting etc.), it means 'unusually' or<br>
'surprisingly'. For example, rather nice = unusually nice/surprisingly nice/nicer than expected:<br>
* These oranges are rather nice. Where did you get them?<br>
* Ann didn't like the book but I thought it was rather interesting. (=more interesting than expected)<br>
Rather can go before or after a/an. So you can say:<br>
a rather interesting book or rather an interesting book<br>

</div>


<div class="sec">
	<div class="section"> <B>C</B> <br>Quite also means 'completely'. For example:</div><br>
    * 'Are you sure?' 'Yes, quite sure.' (= completely sure)<br>
Quite means 'completely' with a number of adjectives, especially:<br>
[sure, right, true, clear, different, incredible, amazing, certain, wrong, safe, obvious, unnecessary,<br>
[sure, right, true, clear, different, incredible, amazing, certain, wrong, safe, obvious, unnecessary, extraordinary, impossible]<br>
* She was quite different from what I expected. (= completely different)<br>
* Everything they said was quite true. (= completely true)<br>
We also use quite (='completely') with some verbs. For example:<br>
* I quite agree with you. (= I completely agree) Not quite = 'not completely':<br>
* They haven't quite finished their dinner yet.<br>
* I don't quite understand what you mean.<br>
* 'Are you ready yet?' 'Not quite.' (= not completely)<br>
