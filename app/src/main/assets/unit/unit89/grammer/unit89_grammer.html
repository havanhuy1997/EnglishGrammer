<div class="sec">
	<div class="section"> <B>A</B> <br>All and everybody/everyone</div><br>
    We do not normally use all to mean everybody/everyone:<br>
* Everybody enjoyed the party. (not 'All enjoyed...')<br>
But note that we say all of us/you/them, not 'everybody of...':<br>
* All of us enjoyed the party. (not 'everybody of us')<br>

</div>


<div class="sec">
	<div class="section"> <B>B</B> <br>All and everything</div><br>
    Sometimes you can use all or everything:<br>
* I'll do all I can to help. or I'll do everything I can to help.<br>
You can say 'all I can'/'all you need' etc. but we do not normally use all alone:<br>
* He thinks he knows everything. (not 'he knows all')<br>
* Our holiday was a disaster. Everything went wrong. (not 'All went wrong')<br>
We use all in the expression all about:<br>
* They told us all about their holiday.<br>
We also use all (not 'everything') to mean the only thing(s):<br>
* All I've eaten today is a sandwich. (= the only thing I've eaten today)<br>

</div>


<div class="sec">
	<div class="section"> <B>C</B> <br>Every/everybody/everyone/everything are singular words, so we use a singular verb:</div><br>
    * Every seat in the theatre was taken.<br>
* Everybody has arrived. (not 'have arrived')<br>
But we often use they/them/their after everybody/everyone:<br>
* Everybody said they enjoyed themselves. (= he or she enjoyed himself or herself)<br>

</div>


<div class="sec">
	<div class="section"> <B>D</B> <br>All and whole</div><br>
    Whole = complete, entire. Most often we use whole with singular nouns:<br>
* Did you read the whole book? (= all the book, not just a part of it)<br>
* She has lived her whole life in Scotland.<br>
We normally use the/my/her etc. before whole. Compare whole and all:<br>
the whole book/all the book her whole life/all her life<br>
You can also use: a whole ....<br>
* Jack was so hungry, he ate a whole packet of biscuits. (= a complete packet)<br>
We do not normally use whole with uncountable nouns. We say:<br>
* I've spent all the money you gave me. (not 'the whole money')<br>

</div>


<div class="sec">
	<div class="section"> <B>E</B> <br>Every/all/whole with time words</div><br>
    We use every to say how often something happens. So we say every day/every Monday/every ten<br>
We use every to say how often something happens. So we say every day/every Monday/every ten minutes/every three weeks etc.:<br>
* When we were on holiday, we went to the beach every day. (not 'all days')<br>
* The bus service is very good. There's a bus every ten minutes.<br>
* Ann gets paid every four weeks.<br>
All day/the whole day = the complete day from beginning to end:<br>
* We spent all day/the whole day on the beach.<br>
* He was very quiet. He didn't say a word all evening/the whole evening.<br>
Note that we say all day (not 'all the day'), all week (not 'all the week') etc.<br>
Compare all the time and every time:<br>
* They never go out. They are at home all the time. (= always--not 'every time')<br>
* Every time I see you, you look different. (= each time, on every occasion)<br>
