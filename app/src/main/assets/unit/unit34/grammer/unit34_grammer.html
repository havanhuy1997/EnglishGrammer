<div class="sec">
	<div class="section"> <B>A</B> <br>You can use should after a number of verbs, especially:</div><br>
    suggest propose recommend insist demand<br>
* They insisted that we should have dinner with them.<br>
* I demanded that he should apologise.<br>
* What do you suggest I should do?<br>
In the same way, you can use should after suggestion/proposal/recommendation etc.<br>
* What do you think of Jane's suggestion that I should buy a car?<br>
and also after 'it's important/vital/necessary/essential that ...'<br>
* It's essential that you should be here on time.<br>

</div>


<div class="sec">
	<div class="section"> <B>B</B> <br>You can also leave out should in all the sentences in Section A:</div><br>
    * It's essential that you be here on time. (= that you should be here)<br>
* I demanded that he apologise.<br>
* What do you suggest I do?<br>
This form (you be/he apologise etc.) is sometimes called the subjunctive.<br>
You can also use normal present and past tenses:<br>
* It's essential that you are here on time.<br>
* I demanded that he apologised.<br>
Be careful with suggest. You cannot use to ... ('to do/to buy' etc.) after suggest:<br>
* What do you suggest we should do?<br>
or What do you suggest we do? (but not 'What do you suggest us to do?')<br>
* Jane suggested that I (should) buy a car.<br>
or Jane suggested that I bought a car. (but not 'Jane suggested me to buy')<br>
For suggest ~ing, see Unit 52.<br>

</div>


<div class="sec">
	<div class="section"> <B>C</B> <br>You can use should after a number of adjectives, especially:</div><br>
    strange odd funny typical natural interesting surprised surprising<br>
* It's strange that he should be late. He's usually on time.<br>
* I was surprised that she should say such a thing.<br>

</div>


<div class="sec">
	<div class="section"> <B>D</B> <br>If ... should...</div><br>
    You can say 'If something should happen...'. For example:<br>
* If Tom should phone while I'm out, tell him I'll phone him back later.<br>
'If Tom should phone' is similar to 'If Tom phones'. With should, the speaker feels that the possibility is<br>
smaller. Another example:<br>
* I've left the washing outside. If it should rain, can you bring it in?<br>
You can also put should at the beginning of these sentences (Should something happen ...):<br>
* Should Tom phone, can you tell him I'll phone him back later?<br>

</div>


<div class="sec">
	<div class="section"> <B>E</B> <br>You can use I should .../I shouldn't ... to give somebody advice. For example:</div><br>
    * 'Shall I leave now?' 'No, I should wait a bit longer.'<br>
Here, 'I should wait'= 'I would wait if I were you, I advise you to wait'. Two more examples:<br>
* It's very cold this morning. I should wear a coat when you go out.<br>
* I shouldn't stay up too late. You'll be tired tomorrow.<br>
