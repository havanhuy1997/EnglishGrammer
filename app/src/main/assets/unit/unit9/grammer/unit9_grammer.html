Have/has been ~ing is the present perfect continuous:<br>
I/we/they/you have (= I've etc.) been doing/waiting/playing etc.<br>
he/she/it has (= he's etc.) been doing/waiting/playing etc.<br>
We use the present perfect continuous for an activity that has recently stopped or just stopped. There is a connection with now:<br>
* You're out of breath. Have you been running? (you're out of breath now)<br>
* Paul is very tired. He's been working very hard. (he's tired now)<br>
* Why are your clothes so dirty? What have you been doing?<br>

    It is raining now. It began raining two hours ago and it is still raining.<br>
How long has it been raining?<br>
It has been raining for two hours.<br>
We often use the present perfect continuous in this way, especially with how long, for ... and since ... The<br>
activity is still happening (as in this example) or has just stopped.<br>
* How long have you been learning English? (you're still learning English)<br>
* Tim is still watching television. He's been watching television all day.<br>
* Where have you been? I've been looking for you for the last half hour.<br>
* George hasn't been feeling well recently.<br>
You can use the present perfect continuous for actions repeated over a period of time:<br>
Debbie is a very good tennis player. She's been playing since she was eight.<br>
Every morning they meet in the same cafe. They've been going there for years.<br>
