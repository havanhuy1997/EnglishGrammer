	<div class="section"> <B>A</B> <br>Compare these examples:</div><br>
    (1) Sue has lost her watch. She thinks it may be at Ann's house.<br>
SUE: I think I left my watch at your house. Have you seen it?<br>
ANN: No, but I'll have a took when I get home. If I find it, I'll tell you.<br>
In this example, Ann feels there is a real possibility that she will find the watch. So she says:<br>
If I find ..., I'll ....<br>
(2) Ann says: If I found a wallet in the street, I'd take it to the police.<br>
This is a different type of situation. Here, Ann is not thinking about a real possibility; she is imagining the<br>
situation and doesn't expect to find a wallet in the street. So she says:<br>
If I found ..., I'd (= I would) ... (not If I find ...,I'll)<br>
When you imagine something like this, you use if + past (if I found/if you were/if we didn't etc.). But the meaning is not past:<br>
* What would you do if you won a million pounds? (we don't really expect this to happen)<br>
* I don't really want to go to their party, but I probably will go. They'd be offended if I didn't go.<br>
* Sarah has decided not to apply for the job. She isn't really qualified for it, so she probably wouldn't get it if she applied.<br>

</div>


<div class="sec">
	<div class="section"> <B>B</B> <br>We do not normally use would in the if-part of the sentence:</div><br>
    * I'd be very frightened if somebody pointed a gun at me. (not 'if somebody would point')<br>
* If I didn't go to their party, they'd be offended. (not 'If I wouldn't go')<br>
But it is possible to say 'if... would' when you ask somebody to do something:<br>
* (from a formal letter) I would be grateful if you would send me your brochure as soon as possible.<br>
* 'Shall I close the door?' 'Yes, please, if you would.'<br>

</div>


<div class="sec">
	<div class="section"> <B>C</B> <br>In the other part of the sentence (not the if-part) we use would ('d)/wouldn't:</div><br>
    * If you took more exercise, you'd (= you would) probably feet healthier,<br>
* Would you mind if I used your phone?<br>
* I'm not tired enough to go to bed yet. I wouldn't steep (if I went to bed now).<br>
Could and might are also possible:<br>
* If you took more exercise, you might feet healthier. (= it is possible that you would feel healthier)<br>
* If it stopped raining, we could go out. (= we would be able to go out)<br>

</div>


<div class="sec">
	<div class="section"> <B>D</B> <br>Do not use when in sentences like those on this page:</div><br>
    * They would be offended if we didn't accept their invitation. (not 'when we didn't')<br>
* What would you do if you were bitten by a snake? (not 'when you were bitten')<br>
