	<div class="section"> <B>A</B> <br>Names without 'the'</div><br>
    We do not use 'the' with names of most streets/roads/squares/parks etc.:<br>
Union Street (not 'the ...') Fifth Avenue Piccadilly Circus Hyde Park Blackrock Road Broadway<br>
Times Square Waterloo Bridge<br>
Many names (especially names of important buildings and institutions) are two words:<br>
Kennedy Airport Cambridge University<br>
The first word is usually the name of a person ('Kennedy') or a place ('Cambridge'). We do not usually use<br>
'the' with names like these. Some more examples:<br>
Victoria Station (not 'the ...') Edinburgh Castle London Zoo Westminster Abbey Buckingham Palace<br>
Canterbury Cathedral<br>
But we say 'the White House', 'the Royal Palace', because 'white' and 'royal' are not names like 'Kennedy'<br>
But we say 'the White House', 'the Royal Palace', because 'white' and 'royal' are not names like 'Kennedy' and 'Cambridge'. This is only a general rule and there are exceptions.<br>
