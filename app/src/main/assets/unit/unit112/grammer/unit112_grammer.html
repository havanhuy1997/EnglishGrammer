	<div class="section"> <B>A</B> <br>Study this example situation:</div><br>
    Last year Jack and Jill spent their holidays by the sea.<br>
It rained a lot but they enjoyed themselves. You can say:<br>
Although it rained a lot, they enjoyed themselves. (= It rained a lot but they ...)<br>
or In spite of the rain, they enjoyed themselves. Despite the rain, they enjoyed themselves.<br>

</div>


<div class="sec">
	<div class="section"> <B>B</B> <br>After although we use a subject + verb:</div><br>
    * Although it rained a lot, we enjoyed our holiday.<br>
* I didn't get the job although I had all the necessary qualifications.<br>
Compare the meaning of although and because:<br>
* We went out although it was raining.<br>
* We didn't go out because it was raining.<br>

</div>


<div class="sec">
	<div class="section"> <B>C</B> <br>After in spite of or despite, we use a noun, a pronoun (this/that/what etc.) or ~ing:</div><br>
    * In spite of the rain, we enjoyed our holiday.<br>
* I didn't get the job in spite of having all the necessary qualifications.<br>
* She wasn't well, but in spite of this she went to work.<br>
* In spite of what I said yesterday, I still love you.<br>
Despite is the same as in spite of. Note that we say 'in spite of', but despite (without 'of'):<br>
* She wasn't well, but despite this she went to work. (not 'despite of this')<br>
You can say 'in spite of the fact (that)...' and 'despite the fact (that) ...':<br>
* I didn't get the job in spite of the fact (that) I had all the necessary qualifications.<br>
* I didn't get the job despite of the fact (that) I had all the necessary qualifications.<br>
Compare in spite of and because of:<br>
* We went out in spite of the rain. (or ... despite the rain.)<br>
* We didn't go out because of the rain.<br>

</div>


<div class="sec">
	<div class="section"> <B>D</B> <br>Compare although and in spite of/despite:</div><br>
    * Although the traffic was bad, I arrived on time. (not 'in spite of the traffic was bad')<br>
In spite of the traffic, I arrived on time. (not 'in spite of the traffic was bad')<br>
* I couldn't sleep although I was very tired. (not 'despite I was tired')<br>
* I couldn't sleep despite being very tired. (not 'despite I was tired')<br>

</div>


<div class="sec">
	<div class="section"> <B>E</B> <br>Sometimes we use though instead of although:</div><br>
    * I didn't get the job though I had all the necessary qualifications.<br>
In spoken English we often use though at the end of a sentence:<br>
* The house isn't very nice. I like the garden though. (= but I like the garden)<br>
* I see him every day. I've never spoken to him though. (= but I've never spoken to him)<br>
Even though (but not 'even' alone) is a stronger form of although:<br>
* Even though I was really tired, I couldn't sleep. (not 'Even I was really tired ...')<br>
