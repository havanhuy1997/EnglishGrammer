<div class="sec">
	<div class="section"> <B>A</B> <br>Before comparatives you can use:</div><br>
    much, a lot, far (=a lot), a bit, a little, slightly (= a little)<br>
* Let's go by car. It's much cheaper. (or It's a lot cheaper.)<br>
* Don't go by train. It's a lot more expensive. (or It's much more expensive.)<br>
* Could you speak a bit more slowly? (or ... speak a little more slowly?)<br>
* This bag is slightly heavier than the other one.<br>
* Her illness was far more serious than we thought at first. (or ... much more serious... or ... a lot more<br>
serious ... )<br>

</div>


<div class="sec">
	<div class="section"> <B>B</B> <br>You can use any and no + comparatives (any longer/no bigger etc.):</div><br>
    * I've waited long enough. I'm not waiting any longer. (= not even a little longer)<br>
* We expected their house to be very big but it's no bigger than ours. (or it isn't any bigger than ours.)<br>
* Yesterday you said you felt ill. Do you feel any better today?<br>
* This hotel is better than the other one and it's no more expensive.<br>

</div>


<div class="sec">
	<div class="section"> <B>C</B> <br>Harder and harder/more and more/more and more difficult etc.</div><br>
    We repeat comparatives like this (... and ...) to say that something is changing continuously:<br>
* It's becoming harder and harder to find a job.<br>
* It's becoming more and more difficult to find a job.<br>
* Your English is improving. It's getting better and better.<br>
* These days more and more people are learning English.<br>

</div>


<div class="sec">
	<div class="section"> <B>D</B> <br>The ... the better</div><br>
    Study these examples:<br>
* 'What time shall we leave?' 'The sooner the better.' (= as soon as possible)<br>
* 'What sort of box do you want? A big one?' 'Yes, the bigger the better.' (= as big as possible)<br>
* When you're travelling, the less luggage you have to carry the better. (= it is best to have as little luggage<br>
* When you're travelling, the less luggage you have to carry the better. (= it is best to have as little luggage as possible)<br>
We also use the ... the ... (with two comparatives) to say that one thing depends on another thing:<br>
* The warmer the weather, the better I feel. (= if the weather is warmer, I feel better)<br>
* The sooner we leave, the sooner we will arrive.<br>
* The younger you are, the easier it is to learn.<br>
* The more expensive the hotel, the better the service.<br>
* The more electricity you use, the higher your bill will be.<br>
* The more I thought about the plan, the less I liked it.<br>

</div>


<div class="sec">
	<div class="section"> <B>E</B> <br>Older and elder</div><br>
    The comparative of old is older:<br>
* Tom looks older than he really is.<br>
You can use elder (or older) when you talk about people in a family. You can say (my) elder<br>
You can use elder (or older) when you talk about people in a family. You can say (my) elder brother/sister/son/daughter:<br>
* My elder brother is a pilot. (or My older brother ...)<br>
We say 'my elder brother' but we do not say that 'somebody is elder ...':<br>
* My brother is older than me. (not 'elder than me')<br>
For eldest, see Unit 107D.<br>
