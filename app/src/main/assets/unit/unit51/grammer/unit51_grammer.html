<div class="sec">
	<div class="section"> <B>A</B> <br>Study these examples:</div><br>
    You haven't seen Mary today, have you?<br>
No, I'm afraid not.<br>
It was a good film, wasn't it?<br>
Yes. I really enjoyed it.<br>
Have you? and wasn't it? are question tags (= mini-questions that we often put on the end of a sentence in<br>
spoken English). In question tags, we use an auxiliary verb (have/was/will etc.).<br>
We use do/does/did for the present and past simple (see also Unit 50):<br>
* 'Karen plays the piano, doesn't she?' 'Well, yes, but not very well.'<br>
* 'You didn't lock the door, did you?' 'No, I forgot.'<br>

</div>


<div class="sec">
	<div class="section"> <B>B</B> <br>Normally we use a negative question tag after a positive sentence:</div><br>
    positive sentence + negative tag<br>
Mary will be here soon, won't she?<br>
There was a lot of traffic, wasn't there?<br>
Jim should pass the exam, shouldn't he?<br>
... and a positive question tag after a negative sentence:<br>
negative sentence + positive tag<br>
Mary won't be late, will she?<br>
They don't like us, do they?<br>
You haven't got a car, have you?<br>
Notice the meaning of yes and no in answer to a negative sentence:<br>
* You're not going out today, are you? Yes. (Yes, I am going out)<br>
* You're not going out today, are you? No. (No, I am not going out)<br>

</div>


<div class="sec">
	<div class="section"> <B>C</B> <br>The meaning of a question tag depends on how you say it. If your voice goes down, you aren't really asking a question; you are only inviting the listener to agree with you:</div><br>
    * 'It's a nice day, isn't it?' 'Yes, lovely.'<br>
* 'Tim doesn't look well today, dose he? 'No, he looks very tired.'<br>
* She's very pretty. She's got beautiful eyes, hasn't she?<br>
But if the voice goes up, it is a real question:<br>
* 'You haven't seen Mary today, have you?' 'No, I'm afraid not.'<br>
(= Have you seen Mary today by any chance?)<br>
We often use a negative sentence + positive tag to ask for things or information, or to ask somebody to do something. The voice goes up at the end of the tag in sentences like these:<br>
* 'You haven't got a pen, have you?' 'Yes, here you are.'<br>
* 'You couldn't do me a favour, could you?' 'It depends what it is.'<br>
* 'You don't know where Karen is, do you?'Sorry, I've no idea.'<br>

</div>


<div class="sec">
	<div class="section"> <B>D</B> <br>After Let's... the question tag is ... shall we?:</div><br>
    Let's go for a walk, shall we?<br>
After the imperative (Do.../Don't do... etc.), the tag is usually ... will you?:<br>
Open the door, will you?<br>
Don't be late, will you?<br>
Note that we say ... aren't I? (= am I not?):<br>
I'm late, aren't I?<br>
