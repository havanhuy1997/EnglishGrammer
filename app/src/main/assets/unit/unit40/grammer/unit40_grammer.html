<div class="sec">
	<div class="section"> <B>A</B> <br>We use would ('d) when we imagine a situation or action:</div><br>
    * It would be nice to have a holiday but we can't afford it.<br>
* I'm not going to bed yet. I'm not tired and I wouldn't sleep.<br>
We use would have (done) when we imagine situations or actions in the past:<br>
* They helped me a lot. I don't know what I would have done without their help.<br>
* I didn't go to bed. I wasn't tired, so I wouldn't have slept.<br>
For would in sentences with if see Units 37-39.<br>

</div>


<div class="sec">
	<div class="section"> <B>B</B> <br>Compare will ('11) and would ('d):</div><br>
    * I'll stay a bit longer. I've got plenty of time.<br>
* I'd stay a bit longer but I really have to go now. (so I can't stay longer)<br>
Sometimes would/wouldn't is the past of will/won't. Compare:<br>
present -> past<br>
Tom: I'll phone you on Sunday. -> Tom said he'd phone me on Sunday.<br>
ANN: I promise I won't be late. -> Ann promised that she wouldn't be late.<br>
Liz: Damn! The car won't start. -> Liz was angry because the car wouldn't start.<br>

</div>


<div class="sec">
	<div class="section"> <B>C</B> <br>I wish ... would...</div><br>
    Study this example situation:<br>
It is raining. Jill wants to go out, but not in the rain. She says:<br>
I wish it would stop raining.<br>
This means that Jill is complaining about the rain and wants it to stop.<br>
We use I wish ... would... when we want something to happen or when we want somebody to do something.<br>
The speaker is not happy with the present situation.<br>
* The phone has been ringing for five minutes. I wish somebody would answer it.<br>
* I wish you would do something instead of just sitting and doing nothing.<br>
You can use I wish ... wouldn't ... to complain about things people do repeatedly:<br>
* I wish you wouldn't keep interrupting me.<br>
We use I wish ... would ... for actions and changes, not situations. Compare:<br>
* I wish Sarah would come. (= I want her to come)<br>
but * I wish Sarah were (or was) here now. (not 'I wish Sarah would be...')<br>
* I wish somebody would buy me a car.<br>
but * I wish I had a car. (not 'I wish I would have...')<br>
For 'I wish ... were/had (etc.)' see Units 38B and 39C.<br>

</div>


<div class="sec">
	<div class="section"> <B>D</B> <br>You can also use would when you talk about things that happened regularly in the past:</div><br>
    * When we were children, we lived by the sea. In summer, if the weather was fine, we would all get up<br>
early and go for a swim. (= we did this regularly)<br>
* Whenever Arthur was angry, he would walk out of the room.<br>
With this meaning, would is similar to used to (see Unit 18):<br>
* Whenever Arthur was angry, he used to walk out of the room<br>
