	<div class="section"> <B>A</B> <br>Study this example situation:</div><br>
    Tom is looking for his key. He can't find it.<br>
He has lost his key. (present perfect)<br>
This means that he doesn't have his key now.<br>
Ten minutes later:<br>
Now Tom has found his key. He has it now.<br>
Has he lost his key? (present perfect)<br>
No, he hasn't. He has found it.<br>
Did he lose his key? (past simple)<br>
Yes, he did.<br>
He lost his key (past simple)<br>
but now he has found it. (present perfect)<br>
The present perfect is a present tense. It always tells us something about now. 'Tom has lost his key' = he doesn't have his key now (see Unit 7).<br>
The past simple tells us only about the past. If somebody says 'Tom lost his key', we don't know whether<br>
he has it now or not. We only know that he lost it at some time in the past.<br>
Two more examples:<br>
* Jack grew a beard but now he has shaved it off. (so he doesn't have a beard now)<br>
* They went out after lunch and they've just come back. (so they are back now)<br>

</div>


<div class="sec">
	<div class="section"> <B>B</B> <br>Do not use the present perfect if there is no connection with the present (for example, things that happened a long time ago):</div><br>
    * The Chinese invented printing. (not 'have invented')<br>
* How many plays did Shakespeare write? (not 'has Shakespeare written')<br>
* Beethoven was a great composer. (not 'has been')<br>
Compare:<br>
* Shakespeare wrote many plays.<br>
* My sister is a writer. She has written many books. (she still writes books)<br>

</div>


<div class="sec">
	<div class="section"> <B>C</B> <br>We use the present perfect to give new information (see Unit 7). But if we continue to talk about it, we normally use the past simple:</div><br>
    * A: Ow! I've burnt myself.<br>
B: How did you do that? (not 'have you done')<br>
A: I picked up a hot dish. (not 'have picked')<br>
* A: Look! Somebody has spilt milk on the carpet.<br>
B: Well, it wasn't me. I didn't do it. (not 'hasn't been ... haven't done')<br>
A: I wonder who it was then. (not 'who it has been')<br>
