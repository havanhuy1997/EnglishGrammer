Geoff is a football referee. He always wears two watches during a game because it is possible that one watch will stop.<br>
He wears two watches in case one of them stops.<br>
In case one of them stops ='because it is possible one of them will stop'.<br>
Some more examples of in case:<br>
* Ann might phone tonight. I don't want to go out in case she phones. (= because it is possible she will<br>
* Ann might phone tonight. I don't want to go out in case she phones. (= because it is possible she will phone)<br>
* I'll draw a map for you in case you can't find our house. (= because it is possible you won't be able to find<br>
* I'll draw a map for you in case you can't find our house. (= because it is possible you won't be able to find it)<br>

* I don't think it will rain but I'll take an umbrella just in case. (=just in case it rains) Do not use will after in<br>
* I don't think it will rain but I'll take an umbrella just in case. (=just in case it rains) Do not use will after in case. Use a present tense for the future (see also Unit 25):<br>
* I don't want to go out tonight in case Ann phones. (not 'in case Ann will phone')<br>

    You do something now in case something happens later. Compare:<br>
#1 in case<br>
* We'll buy some more food in case Tom comes.<br>
(= Perhaps Tom will come; we'll buy some more food now, whether he comes or not; then we'll already<br>
have the food if he comes.)<br>
* I'll give you my phone number in case you need to contact me.<br>
* You should insure your bicycle in case it is stolen.<br>
#2 if<br>
* We'll buy some more food if Tom comes.<br>
(= Perhaps Tom will come; if he comes, we'll buy some more food; if he doesn't come, we won't buy any<br>
more food.)<br>
* You can phone me at the hotel if you need to contact me.<br>
* You should inform the police if your bicycle is stolen.<br>

<div class="sec">
	<div class="section"> <B>C</B> <br>You can use in case (+ past) to say why somebody did something:</div><br>
    * We bought some more food in case Tom came. (= because it was possible that Tom would come)<br>
* I drew a map for Sarah in case she couldn't find the house.<br>
* We rang the bell again in case they hadn't heard it the first time.<br>

* In case of emergency, telephone this number. (= if there is an emergency)<br>
