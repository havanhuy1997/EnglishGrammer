	<div class="section"> <B>A</B> <br>Look again at these example sentences from Unit 91:</div><br>
    * The woman [who] lives next door is a doctor. (or The woman that lives...)<br>
[The woman] lives next door. who(= the woman) is the subject<br>
* Where is the cheese [that] was in the fridge? (or ... the cheese which was...)<br>
[The cheese] was in the fridge. that(= the cheese) is the subject<br>
You must use who/that/which when it is the subject of the relative clause. You cannot say 'The woman<br>
You must use who/that/which when it is the subject of the relative clause. You cannot say 'The woman lives next door is a doctor' or 'Where is the cheese was in the fridge?'<br>

</div>


<div class="sec">
	<div class="section"> <B>B</B> <br>Sometimes who/that/which is the object of the verb. For example:</div><br>
    *. The woman [who] I wanted to see was away on holiday.<br>
I wanted to see [the woman]. who(= the woman) is the object. I is the subject<br>
* Have you found the keys [that] you lost?<br>
You lost [the keys]. that(= the keys) is the object. you is the subject<br>
When who/that/which is the object, you can leave it out. So you can say:<br>
* The woman I wanted to see was away. or The woman who I wanted to see...<br>
* Have you found the keys you lost? or ... the keys that you lost?<br>
* The dress Ann bought doesn't fit her very well. or The dress that Ann bought...<br>
* Is there anything I can do? or ... anything that I can do?<br>
Note that we say:<br>
the keys you lost (not 'the keys you lost them')<br>
the keys you lost (not 'the keys you lost them') the dress Ann bought (not 'bought it')<br>

</div>


<div class="sec">
	<div class="section"> <B>C</B> <br>Notice the position of prepositions(in/at/with etc.) in relative clauses:</div><br>
    do you know the woman?--Tom is talking [to] her<br>
-> Do you know the woman (who/that) Tom is talking [to]?<br>
the bed--I slept [in] it last night - wasn't very comfortable<br>
-> The bed (that/which) I slept in last night wasn't very comfortable.<br>
* Are these the keys (that/which) you were looking for?<br>
* The woman (who/that) he fell in love with left him after a few weeks.<br>
* The man (who/that) I was sitting next to on the plane talked all the time.<br>
In all these examples, you can leave out who/that/which.<br>
Note that we say:<br>
the books you were looking for (not 'the books you were looking for them')<br>

</div>


<div class="sec">
	<div class="section"> <B>D</B> <br>You cannot use what in sentences like these:</div><br>
    * Everything (that) they said was true. (not 'Everything what they said ...')<br>
* I gave her all the money (that) I had. (not '... all the money what I had')<br>
What = the thing(s) that:<br>
* Did you hear what they said? (= the things that they said)<br>
