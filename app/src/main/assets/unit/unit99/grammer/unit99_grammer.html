    * Our holiday was too short - the time went very quickly.<br>
* The driver of the car was seriously injured in the accident.<br>
Quickly and seriously are adverbs. Many adverbs are made from an adjective + -1y:<br>
adjective: quick serious careful quiet heavy bad<br>
adverb: quickly seriously carefully quietly heavily badly<br>
For spelling, see Appendix 6.<br>
Not all words ending in -ly are adverbs. Some adjectives end in -ly too, for example:<br>
friendly lively elderly lonely silly lovely<br>

#1 Adjectives (quick/careful etc.) tell us about a noun. We use adjectives before nouns and after some verbs, especially be:<br>
* Tom is a careful driver. (not 'a carefully driver')<br>
* We didn't go out because of the heavy rain.<br>
* Please be quiet.<br>
* I was disappointed that my exam results were so bad.<br>
We also use adjectives after the verbs look/feel/sound etc. (see Unit 98D):<br>

* We didn't go out because it was raining heavily. (not 'raining heavy')<br>
* Please speak quietly. (not 'speak quiet')<br>
* I was disappointed that I did so badly in the exam. (not 'did so bad')<br>
Why do you never take me seriously?<br>

* She speaks perfect English.(adjective + noun)<br>
* She speaks English perfectly.(verb + object + adverb)<br>
Compare these sentences with look:<br>
* Tom looked sad when I saw him. (= he seemed sad, his expression was sad)<br>
* Tom looked at me sadly. (= he looked at me in a sad way)<br>

reasonably cheap (adverb + adjective) terribly sorry (adverb + adjective)<br>
reasonably cheap (adverb + adjective) terribly sorry (adverb + adjective) incredibly quickly (adverb + adverb)<br>

* Oh, I'm terribly sorry. I didn't mean to push you. (not 'terrible sorry')<br>
* Maria learns languages incredibly quickly.<br>
* The examination was surprisingly easy.<br>
You can also use an adverb before a past participle (injured/organised/written etc.)<br>
* Two people were seriously injured in the accident. (not 'serious injured')<br>
* The meeting was very badly organised.<br>
