    On time = punctual, not late. If something happens on time, it happens at the time which was planned:<br>
* The 11.45 train left on time. (=it left at 11.45)<br>
* 'I'll meet you at 7.30.' 'OK, but please be on time.' (= don't be late, be there at 7.30) * The conference was<br>
* 'I'll meet you at 7.30.' 'OK, but please be on time.' (= don't be late, be there at 7.30) * The conference was very well organised. Everything began and finished on time.<br>

* Be on time. Don't be late.]<br>
In time (for something/to do something) = soon enough<br>
* Will you be home in time for dinner? (= soon enough for dinner)<br>
* I've sent Jill her birthday present. I hope it arrives in time (for her birthday). (= soon enough for her<br>
* I've sent Jill her birthday present. I hope it arrives in time (for her birthday). (= soon enough for her birthday)<br>

The opposite of in time is too late:<br>
