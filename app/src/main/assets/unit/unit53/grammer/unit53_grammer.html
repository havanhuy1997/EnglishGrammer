    If these verbs are followed by another verb, the structure is usually verb + to ... (infinitive):<br>
* It was late, so we decided to take a taxi home.<br>
* Simon was in a difficult situation, so I agreed to lend him some money.<br>
* How old were you when you learnt to drive? (or 'learnt how to drive')<br>
* I waved to Karen but failed to attract her attention.<br>
Note these examples with the negative not to ...:<br>
* We decided not to go out because of the weather.<br>
* I promised not to be late.<br>
With many verbs you cannot normally use to... . For example, enjoy/think/suggest:<br>
* I enjoy dancing. (not 'enjoy to dance')<br>
* Ian suggested going to the cinema. (not 'suggested to go')<br>
* Are you thinking of buying a car? (not 'thinking to buy')<br>
For verb + ~ing, see Unit 52. For verb + preposition + ~ing, see Unit 61.<br>

<div class="sec">
	<div class="section"> <B>B</B> <br>We also use to... after: seem appear tend pretend claim. For example:</div><br>
    * They seem to have plenty of money,<br>
* I like George but I think he tends to talk too much.<br>
* Ann pretended not to see me as she passed me in the street.<br>
There is also a continuous infinitive (to be doing) and a perfect infinitive (to have done):<br>
* I pretended to be reading the newspaper. (= I pretended that I was reading)<br>
* You seem to have lost weight. (= it seems that you have lost weight)<br>

</div>


<div class="sec">
	<div class="section"> <B>C</B> <br>We say 'decide to do something', 'promise to do something' etc. In the same way, we say 'a decision</div><br>
    to do something', 'a promise to do something' etc. (noun + to..).<br>
* I think his decision to give up his Job was stupid.<br>
* George has a tendency to talk too much.<br>

</div>


<div class="sec">
	<div class="section"> <B>D</B> <br>After dare you can use the infinitive with or without to:</div><br>
    * I wouldn't dare to tell him. or I wouldn't dare tell him.<br>
But after daren't (or dare not), you must use the infinitive without to:<br>
* I daren't tell him what happened. (not 'I daren't to tell him')<br>

</div>
