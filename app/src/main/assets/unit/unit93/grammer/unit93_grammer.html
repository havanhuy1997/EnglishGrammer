	<div class="section"> <B>A</B> <br>Whose</div><br>
    We use whose in relative clauses instead of his/her/their:<br>
we saw some people - [their] car had broken down<br>
-> We saw some people [whose] car had broken down.<br>
We use whose mostly for people:<br>
* A widow is a woman whose husband is dead. (her husband is dead)<br>
* What's the name of the man whose car you borrowed? (you borrowed his car)<br>
* A few days ago I met someone whose brother I went to school with. J went to school with his/her brother)<br>
Compare who and whose:<br>
* I met a man who knows you. (be knows you)<br>
* I met a man whose sister knows you. (his sister knows you)<br>

Whom is possible instead of who when it is the object of the verb in the relative clause (like the sentences in Unit 92B):<br>
* The woman whom I wanted to see was away on holiday. (I wanted to see her)<br>
You can also use whom with a preposition (to whom/from whom/with whom etc.):<br>
* The woman with whom he fell in love left him after a few weeks. (he fell in love with her)<br>
But we do not often use whom. In spoken English we usually prefer who or that, or nothing (see Unit 92).<br>
So we usually say:<br>
* The man I saw. or The man who/that I saw.<br>
* The woman he fell in love with. or The woman who/that he fell in love with.<br>
For whom see also Units 94-95.<br>

<div class="sec">
	<div class="section"> <B>C</B> <br>Where</div><br>
    You can use where in a relative clause to talk about a place:<br>
the hotel--we stayed [there]--wasn't very clean<br>
-> The hotel [there] we stayed wasn't very clean.<br>
* I recently went back to the town where I was born. (or ... the town I was born in. or ... the town that I was<br>
born in.)<br>
* I would like to live in a country where there is plenty of sunshine.<br>

the day/the year/the time(etc.) something happens or the day/the year/the time(etc.) that something happens<br>
* Do you still remember the day (that) we first met?<br>
* The last time (that) I saw her, she looked very well.<br>
