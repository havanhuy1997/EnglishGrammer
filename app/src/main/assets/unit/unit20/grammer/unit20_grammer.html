	<div class="section"> <B>A</B> <br>'I am going to do something' = I have already decided to do it, I intend to do it:</div><br>
    * A: There's a film on television tonight. Are you going to watch it?<br>
B: No, I'm tired. I'm going to have an early night.<br>
* A: I hear Ruth has won some money. What is she going to do with it?<br>
B: She's going to buy a new car.<br>
* A: Have you made the coffee yet?<br>
B: I'm just going to make it. (just = right at this moment)<br>
* This food looks horrible. I'm not going to eat it.<br>

<div class="sec">
	<div class="section"> <B>B</B> <br>I am doing and I am going to do</div><br>
    We normally use I am doing (present continuous) when we say what we have arranged to do for example,<br>
arranged to meet somebody, arranged to go somewhere (see Unit 19A):<br>
* What time are you meeting Ann this evening?<br>
* I'm leaving tomorrow. I've got my plane ticket.<br>
'I am going to do something' = I've decided to do it (but perhaps not arranged to do it):<br>
* 'The windows are dirty.' 'Yes, I know. I'm going to clean them later.' (= I've decided to clean them but I haven't arranged to clean them)<br>
* I've decided not to stay here any longer. Tomorrow I'm going to look for somewhere else to stay.<br>
Often the difference is very small and either form is possible.<br>

</div>


<div class="sec">
	<div class="section"> <B>C</B> <br>You can also say that 'something is going to happen' in the future. For example:</div><br>
    The man can't see where he's walking. There is a hole in front of him.<br>
He is going to fall into the hole.<br>
When we say that 'something is going to happen', the situation now makes us believe this. The man is<br>
walking towards the hole now, so he is going to fall into it.<br>
* Look at those black clouds! It's going to rain. (the clouds are there now)<br>
* I feel terrible. I think I'm going to be sick. (I feel terrible now)<br>

</div>


<div class="sec">
	<div class="section"> <B>D</B> <br>'I was going to (do something)' = I intended to do it but didn't do it:</div><br>
    * We were going to travel by train but then we decided to go by car instead.<br>
* A: Did Peter do the examination?<br>
B: No, he was going to do it but he changed his mind.<br>
* I was just going to cross the road when somebody shouted 'Stop!'<br>
You can say that something was going to happen (but didn't happen):<br>
* I thought it was going to rain but then the sun came out<br>
