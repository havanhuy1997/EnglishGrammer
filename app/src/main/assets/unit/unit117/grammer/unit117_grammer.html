<div class="sec">
	<div class="section"> <B>B</B> <br>You can also say It looks/sounds/smells as if (or as though):</div><br>

* We took an umbrella with us because it looked as if it was going to rain.<br>
* Do you hear that music next door? It sounds as if they're having a party.<br>

<div class="sec">
	<div class="section"> <B>C</B> <br>You can use as if with other verbs to say how somebody does something:</div><br>
    * He ran as if he was running for his life.<br>

<div class="sec">
	<div class="section"> <B>D</B> <br>After as if we sometimes use the past when we are talking about the present.</div><br>
    For example:<br>
* I don't like Norma. She talks as if she knew everything.<br>
The meaning is not past in this sentence. We use the past ('as if she knew') because the idea is not real:<br>
Norma does not know everything. We use the past in the same way with if and wish (see Unit 38).<br>
Some more examples:<br>
* She's always asking me to do things for her--as if I didn't have enough to do. (I do have enough to do)<br>
* Harry's only 40. Why do you talk about him as if he was an old man? (he isn't an old man)<br>
When you use the past in this way, you can use were instead of was:<br>
* Why do you talk about him as if he were an old man?<br>
* They treat me as if I were (or was) their own son. (I'm not their son)<br>
