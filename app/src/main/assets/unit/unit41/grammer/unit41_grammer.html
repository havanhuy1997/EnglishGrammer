	<div class="section"> <B>A</B> <br>Study this example:</div><br>
    This house was built in 1930.<br>
'Was built' is passive. Compare active and passive:<br>
Somebody built this house (object) in 1930. (active)<br>
This house (subject) was built in 1930. (passive)<br>
We use an active verb to say what the subject does:<br>
* My grandfather was a builder. He built this house in 1930.<br>
* It's a big company. It employs two hundred people.<br>
We use a passive verb to say what happens to the subject:<br>
* This house is quite old. It was built in 1930.<br>
* Two hundred people are employed by the company.<br>

</div>


<div class="sec">
	<div class="section"> <B>B</B> <br>When we use the passive, who or what causes the action is often unknown or unimportant:</div><br>
    * A lot of money was stolen in the robbery. (somebody stole it but we don't know who)<br>
* Is this room cleaned every day? (does somebody clean it?--it's not important who)<br>
If we want to say who does or what causes the action, we use by...<br>
* This house was built by my grandfather.<br>
* Two hundred people are employed by the company.<br>

</div>


<div class="sec">
	<div class="section"> <B>C</B> <br>The passive is be (is/was/have been etc.) + the past participle (done/cleaned/seen etc.):</div><br>
    (be) done (be) cleaned (be) seen (be) damaged (be) built etc.<br>
For irregular past participles (done/known/seen etc.), see Appendix 1.<br>
Study the active and passive forms of the present simple and past simple:<br>
Present simple<br>
active: clean(s)/see(s) etc.<br>
Somebody cleans this every day.<br>
passive: am/is/are cleaned/seen etc.<br>
This room is cleaned every day.<br>
* Many accidents are caused by careless driving.<br>
* I'm not often invited to parties.<br>
* How is this word pronounced?<br>
Present simple<br>
