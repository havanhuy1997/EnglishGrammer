	<div class="section"> <B>A</B> <br>Study this example situation:</div><br>
    Sarah went to a party last week. Paul went to the party too but they didn't see each other. Paul went home at 10.30 and Sarah arrived at 11 o'clock. So:<br>
When Sarah arrived at the party, Paul wasn't there. He had gone home.<br>
Had gone is the past perfect (simple):<br>
I/we/they/you or he/she/it had (= I'd etc./he'd etc.) gone/seen/finished etc.<br>
The past perfect simple is had + past participle (gone/seen/finished etc.). For a list of irregular verbs, see Appendix 1.<br>
Sometimes we talk about something that happened in the past:<br>
* Sarah arrived at the party.<br>
This is the starting point of the story. Then, if we want to talk about things that happened before this time, we use the past perfect (had ... ):<br>
* When Sarah arrived at the party, Paul had already gone home.<br>
Some more examples:<br>
* When we got home last night, we found that somebody had broken into the flat.<br>
* Karen didn't want to come to the cinema with us because she had already seen the film.<br>
* At first I thought I'd done the right thing, but I soon realised that I'd made a serious mistake.<br>
* The man sitting next to me on the plane was very nervous. He hadn't flown before./He had never flown before.<br>

<div class="sec">
	<div class="section"> <B>B</B> <br>Had done (past perfect) is the past of have done (present perfect). Compare:</div><br>
    present perfect<br>
* Who is that woman? I've never seen her before.<br>
* We aren't hungry. We've just had lunch.<br>
* The house is dirty. They haven't cleaned it for weeks.<br>
past perfect<br>
* I didn't know who she was. I'd never seen her before. (= before that time)<br>
* We weren't hungry. We'd just had lunch.<br>
* The house was dirty. They hadn't cleaned it for weeks.<br>

</div>


<div class="sec">
	<div class="section"> <B>C</B> <br>Compare the past perfect (I had done) and past simple (I did):</div><br>
    * 'Was Tom at the party when you arrived?' 'No, he had already gone home.'<br>
but 'Was Tom there when you arrived?' 'Yes, but he went home soon afterwards.'<br>
* Ann wasn't at home when I phoned. She was in London.<br>
but Ann had just got home when I phoned. She had been in London.<br>
