<div class="sec">
	<div class="section"> <B>A</B> <br>We use must and have to to say that it is necessary to do something. Sometimes it doesn't matter</div><br>
    which you use:<br>
* Oh, it's later than I thought. I must go. or I have to go.<br>
But there is a difference between must and have to and sometimes this is important:<br>
Must is personal. We use must when we give our personal feelings.<br>
'You must do something' = 'I (the speaker) say it is necessary':<br>
* She's a really nice person. You must meet her. (= I say this is necessary)<br>
* I haven't phoned Ann for ages. I must phone her tonight.<br>
Compare:<br>
* I must get up early tomorrow. There are a lot of things I want to do.<br>
Have to is impersonal. We use have to for facts, not for our personal feelings.<br>
'You have to do something' because of a rule or the situation:<br>
* You can't turn right here. You have to turn left. (because of the traffic system)<br>
* My eyesight isn't very good. I have to wear glasses for reading.<br>
* George can't come out with us this evening. He has to work.<br>
* I have to get up early tomorrow. I'm going away and my train leaves at 7.30.<br>
If you are not sure which to use, it is usually safer to use have to.<br>

</div>


<div class="sec">
	<div class="section"> <B>B</B> <br>you can use must to talk about the present or future, but not the past:</div><br>
    * We must go now.<br>
* We must go tomorrow. (but not 'We must go yesterday')<br>
You can use have to in all forms. For example:<br>
* I had to go to hospital. (past)<br>
* Have you ever had to go to hospital? (present perfect)<br>
* I might have to go to hospital. (infinitive after might)<br>
In questions and negative sentences with have to, we normally use do/does/did:<br>
* What do I have to do to get a driving licence? (not 'What have I to do?')<br>
* Why did you have to go to hospital?<br>
* Karen doesn't have to work on Saturdays.<br>

</div>


<div class="sec">
	<div class="section"> <B>C</B> <br>Mustn't and don't have to are completely different:</div><br>
    You mustn't do something = it is necessary that you do not do it (so, don't do it):<br>
* You must keep it a secret. You mustn't tell anyone. (= don't tell anyone)<br>
* I promised I would be on time. I mustn't be late. (= I must be on time)<br>
You don't have to do something = you don't need to do it (but you can if you want):<br>
* You can tell me if you want but you don't have to tell me. (= you don't need to tell me)<br>
* I'm not working tomorrow, so I don't have to get up early.<br>

</div>


<div class="sec">
	<div class="section"> <B>D</B> <br>You can use 'have got to' instead of 'have to'. So you can say:</div><br>
    * I've got to work tomorrow. or have to work tomorrow.<br>
* When has Ann got to go? or When does Ann have to go?<br>
