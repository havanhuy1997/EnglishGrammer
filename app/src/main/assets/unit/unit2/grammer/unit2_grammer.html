		<div class="section"> <B>B</B> <br>We use the present simple to talk about things in general. We are not thinking only about now. We
use it to say that something happens all the time or repeatedly, or that something is true in general. It is not
important whether the action is happening at the time of speaking:</div>
		<br>
		+  Nurses <b>took</b> after patients in hospitals.<br>
		+  I usually <b>go</b> away at weekends.<br>
		+  The earth <b>goes</b> round the sun. <br>
		<br>
		Remember that we say: he/she/it -s. Don't forget the <b>s</b>:<br>
		I work ... but He work<b>s</b> ... They teach ... but My sister teache<b>s</b> ...<br>
		For spelling (-s or -es), see Appendix 6.

	<div class="sec">	
		<div class="section"> <B>C</B> <br>We use <b>do/does</b> to make questions and negative sentences:</div>
		<div class="box">
			<table style="width: 100%;font-size: 13px">
			  <tr>
				<td align="right"><b>do</b></td>
				<td>drive/work/do etc</td> 
				<td><b> work?/come?/do?</b></td> 	
			  </tr>
			  <tr>
				<td align="right">does</td>
				<td>he/she/it</td>

			<table style="width: 100%;font-size: 13px">

				<td align="right">I/we/you/they</td>
				<td><b>don't</b></td> 
				<td><b>work/come/do</b></td> 
			  </tr>
			  <tr>
				<td align="right">he/she/it</td>
				<td>doesn't</td> 			
				<td><b>work/come/do</b></td> 
			  </tr>			  
			</table> 
		</div>		
		<br>
		+  I come from Canada. Where <b>do</b> you <b>come</b> from?
		+  'Would you like a cigarette?' 'No, thanks. I <b>don't</b> smoke.' 
		+  What <b>does</b> this word <b>mean?</b> (not 'What means this word?') 
		+ Rice <b>doesn't</b> grow in cold climates.
		<br>
		In the following examples do is also the main verb: <br>
		+ 'What <b>do</b> you <b>do</b>?' (= What's your job?) 'I work in a shop.' <br>
		+  He's so lazy. He doesn't <b>do</b> anything to help me. (not 'He doesn't anything') <br>
	</div>
	
	<div class="sec">
		<div class="section"> <B>D</B> <br>I promise/ I apologise etc</div>
		<br>
		Sometimes we do things by saying something. For example, when you <i>promise</i> to do something, you can
say '<b>I promise </b>...'; when you <i>suggest</i> something, you can say <b>I suggest </b>...'. We use the present simple
(promise/suggest etc.) in sentences like this: <br>
		+ I <b>promise</b> I won't be late. (<i>not</i> 'I'm promising')  <br>
		+ 'What do you <b>suggest</b> I do?' 'I <b>suggest </b>that you ...'  <br>
		In the same way we say: <b>I apologise </b>.../<b>I advise </b>.../<b>I insist </b>.../<b>I agree </b>... /<b>I refuse </b>... etc.
