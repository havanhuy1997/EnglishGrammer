<div class="sec">
	<div class="section"> <B>A</B> <br>We use continuous tenses only for actions and happenings (they are eating/it is raining etc.).</div><br>
    Some verbs (for example, know and like) are not action verbs. You cannot say 'I am knowing' or ,they are liking'; you can only say 'I know', 'they like'.<br>
The following verbs are not normally used in continuous tenses:<br>
like love hate want need prefer know realise suppose mean understand believe remember belong contain consist depend seem<br>
* I'm hungry. I want something to eat. (not 'I'm wanting')<br>
* Do you understand what I mean?<br>
* Ann doesn't seem very happy at the moment.<br>
When think means 'believe', do not use the continuous:<br>
* What do you think (= believe) will happen? (not 'what are you thinking')<br>
but * You look serious. What are you thinking about? (= What is going on in your mind?)<br>
* I'm thinking of giving up my job. (= I am considering)<br>
When have means 'possess' etc., do not use the continuous (see Unit 17):<br>
* We're enjoying our holiday. We have a nice room in the hotel. (not 'we're having')<br>
but * We're enjoying our holiday. We're having a great time.<br>

</div>


<div class="sec">
	<div class="section"> <B>B</B> <br>See hear smell taste</div><br>
    We normally use the present simple (not continuous) with these verbs:<br>
* Do you see that man over there? (not 'are you seeing')<br>
* This room smells. Let's open a window.<br>
We often use can + see/hear/smell/taste:<br>
* Listen! Can you hear something?<br>
But you can use the continuous with see (I'm seeing) when the meaning is 'having a meeting with'<br>
(especially in the future--see Unit 19A):<br>
* I'm seeing the manager tomorrow morning.<br>

</div>


<div class="sec">
	<div class="section"> <B>C</B> <br>He is selfish and He is being selfish</div><br>
    The present continuous of be is I am being/he is being/you are being etc.<br>
I'm being = 'I'm behaving/I'm acting'. Compare:<br>
* I can't understand why he's being so selfish. He isn't usually like that. (being selfish = behaving selfishly at the moment)<br>
but * He never thinks about other people. He is very selfish. (not 'he is being') (= he is selfish generally, not only at the moment)<br>
We use am/is/are being to say how somebody is behaving. It is not usually possible in other sentences:<br>
* It's hot today. (not 'it is being hot')<br>
* Sarah is very tired. (not 'is being tired')<br>

</div>


<div class="sec">
	<div class="section"> <B>D</B> <br>Look and feet</div><br>
    You can use the present simple or continuous when you say how somebody looks or feels now:<br>
* You took well today. or You're looking well today.<br>
* How do you feel now? or How are you feeling now?<br>
but * I usually feel tired in the morning. (not 'I'm usually feeling')<br>
