	<div class="section"> <B>A</B> <br>Each and every are similar in meaning. Often it is possible to use each or every:</div><br>
    * Each time (or Every time) I see you, you took different.<br>
* There's a telephone in each room (or every room) of the house.<br>
But each and every are not exactly the same. Study the difference:<br>
#1 We use each when we think of things separately, one by one.<br>
* Study each sentence carefully. (= study the sentences one by one)<br>
Each is more usual for a small number:<br>
* There were four books on the table.<br>
Each book was a different colour.<br>
* (in a card game) At the beginning of the game, each player has three cards.<br>
#2 We use every when we think of things as a group. The meaning is similar to all.<br>
* Every sentence must have a verb. (= all sentences in general)<br>
Every is more usual for a large number:<br>
* Carol loves reading. She has read every book in the library. (=all the books)<br>
* I would like to visit every country in the world. (=all the countries)<br>
Each (but not every) can be used for two things:<br>
* In a football match, each team has 11 players. (not 'every team')<br>
We use every (not each) to say how often something happens:<br>
* 'How often do you go shopping?' 'Every day.' (not 'each day')<br>
* There's a bus every ten minutes. (not 'each ten minutes')<br>

<div class="sec">
	<div class="section"> <B>B</B> <br>Compare the structures we use with each and every:</div><br>
    #1 You can use each with a noun: each book, each student<br>
You can use each alone (without a noun):<br>
* None of the rooms was the same. Each was different. (= each room)<br>
Or you can use each one:<br>
* Each one was different.<br>
You can say each of (the.../these... etc.):<br>
* Read each of these sentences carefully.<br>
* Each of the books is a different colour.<br>
Also each of us/you/them:<br>
* Each of them is a different colour.<br>
#2 You can use every with a noun: every book, every student,<br>
You can say every one (but not every alone):<br>
* 'Have you read all these books?' 'Yes, every one.'<br>
You can say every one of ... (but not 'every of ...')<br>
* I've read every one of those books. (not 'every of those books')<br>
* I've read every one of them.<br>

</div>


<div class="sec">
	<div class="section"> <B>C</B> <br>You can also use each in the middle or at the end of a sentence. For example:</div><br>
    * The students were each given a book. (=Each student was given a book.)<br>
* These oranges cost 25 pence each.<br>

</div>


<div class="sec">
	<div class="section"> <B>D</B> <br>Everyone and every one</div><br>
    Everyone (one word) is only for people (='everybody'). Every one (two words) is for things or people, and is<br>
Everyone (one word) is only for people (='everybody'). Every one (two words) is for things or people, and is similar to each one (see Section B):<br>
* Everyone enjoyed the party. (=Everybody...)<br>
* He is invited to lots of parties and he goes to every one. (=to every party)<br>
