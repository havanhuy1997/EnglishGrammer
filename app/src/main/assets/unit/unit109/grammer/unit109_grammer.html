B. Study these rules for the position of adverbs in the middle of a sentence. (They are only general rules, so there are exceptions.) i) If the verb is one word (goes/fell/cooked etc.), the adverb usually goes before the verb:<br>
Tom always(adverb) goes(verb) to work by car.<br>
I almost(adverb) fell(verb) as I was going down the stairs.<br>
* I cleaned the house and also cooked the dinner. (not 'cooked also')<br>
* Lucy hardly ever watches television and rarely reads newspapers.<br>
Note that these adverbs (always/often/also etc.) go before have to:<br>
* Jim never phones me. I always have to phone him. (not 'I have always to phone')<br>
* Jim never phones me. I always have to phone him. (not 'I have always to phone') ii) But adverbs go after am/is/are/was/were:<br>
* We were feeling very tired and we were also hungry.<br>
* Why are you always late? You're never on time.<br>
* The traffic isn't usually as bad as it was this morning.<br>
iii) If the verb is two or more words (can remember/doesn't smoke/has been stolen etc.), the adverb goes<br>
iii) If the verb is two or more words (can remember/doesn't smoke/has been stolen etc.), the adverb goes after the first verb (can/doesn't/has etc.):<br>
I can(verb 1) never(adverb) remember(verb 2) his name.<br>
Ann doesn't(verb 1) usually(adverb) smoke.(verb 2)<br>
Are you(verb 1) definitely(adverb) going(verb 2) to the party tomorrow?<br>
Your car has(verb 1) probably(adverb) been(verb 2) stolen.<br>
* My parents have always lived in London.<br>
* Jack can't cook. He can't even boil an egg.<br>
* The house was only built a year ago and it's already falling down.<br>
Note that probably goes before the negative. So we say:<br>
* I probably won't see you. or I will probably not see you. (but not 'I won't probably.')<br>

    D. Sometimes we use is/will/did etc. instead of repeating part of a sentence (see Unit 50A). Note the position of always/never etc. in these sentences:<br>
* He always says he won't be late but he always is. (= he is always late)<br>
* I've never done it and I never will. (= I will never do it) We normally put always/never etc. before the verb<br>
* I've never done it and I never will. (= I will never do it) We normally put always/never etc. before the verb in sentences like these.<br>
