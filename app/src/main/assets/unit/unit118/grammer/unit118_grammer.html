    We use for + a period of time to say bow long something goes on:<br>
for two hours, for a week, for ages For example:<br>
* We watched television for two hours last night.<br>
* Victoria is going away for a week in September.<br>
* Where have you been? I've been waiting for ages.<br>
* Are you going away for the weekend?<br>
We use during + noun to say when something happens (not how long):<br>
during the film during our holiday during the night<br>
For example:<br>
* I fell asleep during the film.<br>
* We met a lot of people during our holiday.<br>
* The ground is wet. It must have rained during the night.<br>
With a 'time word' (for example, the morning/the afternoon/the summer), you can usually say in or during:<br>
* It must have rained in the night. (or ... during the night.)<br>
* I'll phone you sometime during the afternoon. (or ... in the afternoon.)<br>
You cannot use during to say how long something goes on:<br>
* It rained for three days without stopping. (not 'during three days')<br>
Compare during and for:<br>
* I fell asleep during the film. I was asleep for half an hour.<br>
