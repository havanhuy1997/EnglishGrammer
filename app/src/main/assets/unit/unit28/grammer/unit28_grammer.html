	<div class="section"> <B>A</B> <br>Study this example:</div><br>
    We use must to say that we feel sure something is true:<br>
* You've been travelling all day. You must be tired. (Travelling is tiring and you've been travelling all day, so you must be tired.)<br>
* 'Jim is a hard worker.' 'Jim? A hard worker? You must be joking. He's very lazy.'<br>
* Carol must get very bored in her job. She does the same thing every day.<br>
We use can't to say that we feel sure something is not possible:<br>
* You've just had lunch. You can't be hungry already. (People are not normally hungry just after eating a meal. You've just eaten, so you can't be hungry.)<br>
* Brian said he would definitely be here before 9.30. It's 10 o'clock now and he's never late. He can't be coming.<br>
* They haven't lived here for very long. They can't know many people.<br>
Study the structure:<br>
I/you/he (etc.) must/can't be (tired/hungry/at work etc.)<br>
I/you/he (etc.) must/can't be (doing/coming/joking etc.) do/go/know/have etc.<br>
I/you/he (etc.) must/can't do/go/know/have etc.<br>

<div class="sec">
	<div class="section"> <B>B</B> <br>For the past we use must have (done) and can't have (done). Study this example:</div><br>
    George is outside his friends' house.<br>
He has rung the doorbell three times but nobody has answered.<br>
They must have gone out. (otherwise they would have answered)<br>
* The phone rang but I didn't hear it. I must have been asleep.<br>
* I've lost one of my gloves. I must have dropped it somewhere.<br>
* Jane walked past me without speaking. She can't have seen me.<br>
* Tom walked straight into a wall. He can't have been looking where he was going.<br>
Study the structure:<br>
I/you/he (etc.) must/can't have been (asleep/at work etc.)<br>
I/you/he (etc.) must/can't have been (doing/working etc.)<br>
I/you/he (etc.) must/can't have done /gone/known/had etc.<br>
Couldn't have ... is possible instead of can't have...:<br>
* She couldn't have seen me.<br>
* Tom couldn't have been looking where he was going.<br>
