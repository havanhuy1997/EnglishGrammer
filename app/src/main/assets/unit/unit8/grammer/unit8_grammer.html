	<div class="section"> <B>A</B> <br>Study this example conversation:</div><br>
    DAVE: Have you travelled a lot, Jane?<br>
JANE: Yes, I've been to lots of places.<br>
DAVE: Really? Have you ever been to China?<br>
JANE: Yes, I've been to China twice.<br>
DAVE: What about India?<br>
JANE: No, I haven't been to India.<br>
When we talk about a period of time that continues from the past until now, we use the present perfect<br>
(have been/have travelled etc.). Here, Dave and Jane are talking about the places Jane has visited in her life<br>
(which is a period that continues until now).<br>
* Have you ever eaten caviar? (in your life)<br>
* We've never had a car.<br>
* 'Have you read Hamlet?' 'No, I haven't read any of Shakespeare's plays.'<br>
* Susan really loves that film. She's seen it eight times!<br>
* What a boring film! It's the most boring film I've ever seen.<br>
In the following examples too the speakers are talking about a period that continues until now (recently/in the last few days/so far/since breakfast etc.):<br>
* Have you heard from George recently?<br>
* I've met a lot of people in the last few days.<br>
* Everything is going well. We haven't had any problems so far.<br>
* I'm hungry. I haven't eaten anything since breakfast. (= from breakfast until now)<br>
* It's nice to see you again. We haven't seen each other for a long time.<br>

</div>


<div class="sec">
	<div class="section"> <B>B</B> <br>We use the present perfect with today/this morning/this evening etc. when these periods are not finished at the time of speaking (see also Unit 14B):</div><br>
    * I've drunk four cups of coffee today. (perhaps I'll drink more before today is finished)<br>
* Have you had a holiday this year (yet)?<br>
* I haven't seen Tom this morning. Have you?<br>
* Ron hasn't worked very hard this term.<br>

</div>


<div class="sec">
	<div class="section"> <B>C</B> <br>Note that we say 'It's the first time something has happened' (present perfect). For example:</div><br>
    Don is having a driving lesson. He is very nervous and unsure because it is his first lesson.<br>
* It's the first time he has driven a car. (not 'drives') or He has never driven a car before.<br>
* Linda has lost her passport again. It's the second time this has happened. (not 'happens')<br>
* This is a lovely meal. It's the first good meal I've had for ages. (not 'I have')<br>
* Bill is phoning his girlfriend again. That's the third time he's phoned her this evening.<br>
