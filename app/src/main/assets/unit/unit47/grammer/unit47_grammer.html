	<div class="section"> <B>A</B> <br>It is not always necessary to change the verb when you use reported speech. If you report. something and it is still true, you do not need to change the verb:</div><br>
    * direct: Tom said 'New York is more lively than London.'<br>
reported: Tom said that New York is more lively than London.<br>
(New York is still more lively. The situation hasn't changed.)<br>
* direct: Ann said 'I want to go to New York next year.'<br>
reported: Ann said that she wants to go to New York next year.<br>
(Ann still wants to go to New York next year.)<br>
Note that it is also correct to change the verb into the past:<br>
* Tom said that New York was more lively than London.<br>
* Ann said that she wanted to go to New York next year.<br>
But you must use a past form when there is a difference between what was said and what is really true.<br>
Study this example situation:<br>
You met Sonia a few days ago.<br>
She said: 'Jim is ill.' (direct speech)<br>
Later that day you see Jim. He is looking well and carrying a tennis racket.<br>
You say: 'I didn't expect to see you, Jim. Sonia said you were ill.<br>
(not 'Sonia said you are ill', because clearly he is not ill.)<br>

</div>


<div class="sec">
	<div class="section"> <B>B</B> <br>Say and tell</div><br>
    If you say who you are talking to, use tell:<br>
* Sonia told me that you were ill. (not 'Sonia said me')<br>
* What did you tell the police? (not 'say the police')<br>
Otherwise use say:<br>
* Sonia said that you were ill. (not 'Sonia told that ...')<br>
* What did you say?<br>
But you can say something to somebody':<br>
* Ann said goodbye to me and left. (not 'Ann said me goodbye')<br>
* What did you say to the police?<br>

</div>


<div class="sec">
	<div class="section"> <B>C</B> <br>Tell/ask somebody to do something</div><br>
    We also use the infinitive (to do/to stay etc.) in reported speech, especially with tell and ask (for orders and requests):<br>
* direct: 'Stay in bed for a few days,' the doctor said to me.<br>
reported: The doctor told me to stay in bed for a few days.<br>
* direct: 'Don't shout,' I said to Jim.<br>
reported: I told Jim not to shout.<br>
* direct: 'Please don't tell anybody what happened,' Ann said to me.<br>
reported: Ann asked me not to tell anybody what (had) happened.<br>
'... said to do something' is also possible:<br>
* The doctor said to stay in bed for a few days. (but not 'The doctor said me ...')<br>
