<div class="sec">
	<div class="section"> <B>A</B> <br>If a preposition (in/for/about etc.) is followed by a verb, the verb ends in ~ing. For example:</div><br>
    Are you interested in working for us?<br>
I'm not very good at learning languages.<br>
She must be fed up with studying.<br>
What are the advantages of having a car?<br>
This knife is only for cutting bread.<br>
How about playing tennis tomorrow?<br>
I bought a new bicycle instead of going away on holiday.<br>
Carol went to work in spite of feeling ill.<br>
You can also say 'interested in somebody (do)ing .....', fed up with you (do)ing...' etc.:<br>
* I'm fed up with you telling me what to do.<br>

</div>


<div class="sec">
	<div class="section"> <B>B</B> <br>Note the use of the following prepositions + ~ing:</div><br>
    before ~ing and after ~ing:<br>
* Before going out, I phoned Sarah. (not 'Before to go out')<br>
* What did you do after leaving school?<br>
You can also say 'Before I went out ...' and '... after you left school'.<br>
by ~ing (to say bow something happens):<br>
* The burglars got into the house by breaking a window and climbing in.<br>
* You can improve your English by reading more.<br>
* She made herself ill by not eating properly.<br>
without ~ing:<br>
* I ran ten kilometer without stopping.<br>
* They climbed through the window without anybody seeing them. (or ... without being seen.)<br>
* She needs to work without people disturbing her. (or ... without being disturbed.)<br>
* It's nice to go on holiday without having to worry about money.<br>

</div>


<div class="sec">
	<div class="section"> <B>C</B> <br>To ~ing</div><br>
    To is often part of the infinitive (to do/to see etc.):<br>
* We decided to go out.<br>
* Would you like to play tennis?<br>
But to is also a preposition (like in/for/about/from etc.). For example:<br>
* We drove from London to Edinburgh.<br>
* I prefer tea to coffee.<br>
* Are you looking forward to the weekend?<br>
If a preposition is followed by a verb, the verb ends in ~ing; (in doing/about going etc.- see Section A). So,<br>
when to is a preposition and it is followed by a verb, you must say to ~ing:<br>
* I prefer driving to travelling by train. (not 'to travel')<br>
* Are you looking forward to seeing Ann again? (not 'looking forward to see')<br>
For be/get used to ~ing, see Unit 60.<br>
