	<div class="section"> <B>A</B> <br>Study this example situation:</div><br>
    Bob and Alice are married. They got married exactly 20 years ago, so today is their 20th wedding anniversary.<br>
They have been married for 20 years.<br>
We say: They are married. (present)<br>
but How long have they been married? (present perfect) (not 'How long are they married?')<br>
They have been married for 20 years. (not 'They are married for 20 years')<br>
We use the present perfect to talk about something that began in the past and still continues now.<br>
Compare the present and the present perfect:<br>
* Amy is in hospital.<br>
but She has been in hospital since Monday. (not 'Amy is in hospital since Monday')<br>
* We know each other very well.<br>
but We have known each other for a long time. (not 'we know')<br>
* Are you waiting for somebody?<br>
but How long have you been waiting?<br>

</div>


<div class="sec">
	<div class="section"> <B>B</B> <br>I have been doing something (present perfect continuous) = 'I started doing something in the past and</div><br>
    I am still doing it (or have just stopped)':<br>
* I've been learning English for a long time. (not 'I am learning')<br>
* Sorry I'm late. Have you been waiting long?<br>
* It's been raining since I got up this morning.<br>
The action can be a repeated action:<br>
* 'How long have you been driving?' 'Since I was 17.'<br>

</div>


<div class="sec">
	<div class="section"> <B>C</B> <br>I have done (simple) or I have been doing (continuous)</div><br>
    The continuous is more usual with how long, since and for (see also Unit 10B):<br>
* I've been learning English for a long time. (not usually 'I've learnt')<br>
You can normally use either the continuous or simple with live and work:<br>
* John has been living/has lived in London for a long time.<br>
* How long have you been working/have you worked here?<br>
But we use the simple with always:<br>
* John has always lived in London. (not 'has always been living')<br>
You can use the continuous or the simple for actions repeated over a long period:<br>
* I've been collecting/I've collected stamps since I was a child.<br>
Some verbs (for example, know/like/believe) are not normally used in the continuous:<br>
* How long have you known Jane? (not 'have you been knowing')<br>
* I've had a pain in my stomach since I got up this morning.<br>
For a list of these verbs, see Unit 4A. For have see Unit 17.<br>

</div>


<div class="sec">
	<div class="section"> <B>D</B> <br>We use the present perfect simple in negative sentences like these:</div><br>
    * I haven't seen Tom since Monday. (= Monday was the last time I saw him)<br>
* Jane hasn't phoned me for two weeks. (= the last time she phoned was two weeks ago)<br>
