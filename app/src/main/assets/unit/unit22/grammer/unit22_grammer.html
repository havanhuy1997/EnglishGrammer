	<div class="section"> <B>A</B> <br>We do not use will to say what somebody has already arranged or decided to do in the future:</div><br>
    * Ann is working next week. (not 'Ann will work')<br>
* Are you going to watch television this evening? (not 'will you watch')<br>
For 'I'm working ...' and 'Are you going to ...?, see Units 19-20.<br>
But often, when we talk about the future, we are not talking about what somebody has decided to do. For<br>
example:<br>
CHRIS: Do you think Ann will pass the exam?<br>
JOE: Yes, she'll pass easily.<br>
'She'll pass' does not mean 'she has decided to pass'. Joe is saying what he knows or thinks will happen.<br>
He is predicting the future.<br>
When we predict a future happening or situation, we use will/won't.<br>
* Jill has been away a long time. When she returns, she'll find a lot of changes.<br>
* 'Where will you be this time next year)' 'I'll be in Japan.'<br>
* That plate is very hot. If you touch it, you'll burn yourself.<br>
* Tom won't pass the examination. He hasn't worked hard enough for it.<br>
* When will you know your exam results?<br>

</div>


<div class="sec">
	<div class="section"> <B>B</B> <br>We often use will ('ll) with:</div><br>
    probably: I'll probably be home late this evening.<br>
I expect: I haven't seen Carol today. I expect she'll phone this evening.<br>
(I'm) sure: Don't worry about the exam. I'm sure you'll pass.<br>
(I) think: Do you think Sarah will like the present we bought her?<br>
(I) don't think: I don't think the exam will be very difficult.<br>
I wonder: I wonder what will happen.<br>
After (I) hope, we generally use the present:<br>
* I hope Carol phones this evening.<br>
* I hope it doesn't rain tomorrow.<br>

</div>


<div class="sec">
	<div class="section"> <B>C</B> <br>Generally we use will to talk about the future, but sometimes we use will to talk about now. For example:</div><br>
    * Don't phone Ann now. She'll be busy. (= I know she'll be busy now)<br>

</div>


<div class="sec">
	<div class="section"> <B>D</B> <br>I shall .../we shall ...</div><br>
    Normally we use shall only with I and we.<br>
You can say I shall or I will (I'll), we shall or we will (we'll):<br>
* I shall be tired this evening. (or I will be ...)<br>
* We shall probably go to Scotland for our holiday. (or We will probably go ...)<br>
In spoken English we normally use I'll and we'll:<br>
* We'll probably go to Scotland.<br>
The negative of shall is shall not or shan't:<br>
* I shan't be here tomorrow. (or I won't be ...)<br>
Do not use shall with he/she/it/you/they:<br>
* She will be very angry. (not 'she shall be')<br>
