	<div class="section"> <B>A</B> <br>The position of enough</div><br>
    Enough goes after adjectives and adverbs:<br>
* He didn't get the job because he wasn't experienced enough. (not 'enough experienced')<br>
* You won't pass the examination if you don't work hard enough.<br>
* She shouldn't get married yet. She's not old enough.<br>
The opposite is too. (too hard/too old etc.):<br>
* You never stop working. You work too hard. Enough normally goes before nouns:<br>
* He didn't get the job because he didn't have enough experience. (not 'experience enough')<br>
* I'd like to go away on holiday but I haven't got enough money.<br>
* Some of us had to sit on the floor because there weren't enough chairs.<br>
You can also use enough alone (without a noun):<br>
* I'll lend you some money if you haven't got enough.<br>
The opposite is too much.../too many ...:<br>
* We can't go away on holiday. It costs too much (money).<br>
* There are too many people and not enough chairs.<br>

</div>


<div class="sec">
	<div class="section"> <B>B</B> <br>We say enough/too ... for (somebody/something):</div><br>
    * I haven't got enough money for a holiday.<br>
* He wasn't experienced enough for the job.<br>
* This shirt is too big for me. I need a smaller size.<br>
But we usually say enough/too ... to do something (not 'for doing'). So we say:<br>
enough money to buy something, too young to do something etc.<br>
For example:<br>
* I haven't got enough money to go on holiday. (not 'for going')<br>
* He wasn't experienced enough to do the job.<br>
* She's not old enough to get married. or She's too young to get married.<br>
* Let's get a taxi. It's too far to walk home from here.<br>
* There weren't enough chairs for everyone to sit down.<br>
* They spoke too quickly for us to understand.<br>

</div>


<div class="sec">
	<div class="section"> <B>C</B> <br>We say:</div><br>
    The food was very hot. We couldn't eat it.<br>
and: The food was so hot that we couldn't eat it.<br>
but: The food was too hot to eat. (without 'it')<br>
Some more examples like this:<br>
* The wallet was too big to put in my pocket. (not 'too big to put it')<br>
* These boxes are too heavy to carry. (not 'too heavy to carry them')<br>
* The water wasn't clean enough to swim in.<br>
