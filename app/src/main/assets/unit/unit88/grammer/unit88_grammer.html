    A. We use both/neither/either for two things. You can use these words with a noun (both books, neither book etc.)<br>

For example, you are talking about going out to eat this evening. There are two restaurants where you can go. You say:<br>
* Both restaurants are very good. (not 'the both restaurants')<br>
* Neither restaurant is expensive.<br>
* We can go to either restaurant. I don't mind. (either = one or the other, it doesn't matter which one)<br>

</div>


<div class="sec">
	<div class="section"> <B>B</B> <br>Both of .../neither of .../either of ...</div><br>
    When you use both/neither/either + of, you always need the .../these/those .../my/your/his/ Tom's... (etc.).<br>
You cannot say 'both of restaurants'. You have to say 'both of the restaurants', 'both of those restaurants'<br>
You cannot say 'both of restaurants'. You have to say 'both of the restaurants', 'both of those restaurants' etc.:<br>
* Both of these restaurants are very good.<br>
* Neither of the restaurants we went to was (or were) expensive.<br>
* I haven't been to either of those restaurants. (= I haven't been to one or the other)<br>
You don't need of after both. So you can say:<br>
* Both my parents are from London. or Both of my parents...<br>
You can use both of/neither of/either of + us/you/them:<br>
* (talking to two people) Can either of you speak Spanish?<br>
* I asked two people the way to the station but neither of them knew.<br>
You must say 'both of' before us/you/them (of is necessary):<br>
* Both of us were very tired. (not 'Both us were ...')<br>
After neither of ... a singular or a plural verb is possible:<br>
* Neither of the children wants (or want) to go to bed.<br>

* 'Is your friend British or American?' 'Neither. She's Australian.'<br>
* 'Do you want tea or coffee?' 'Either. I don't mind.'<br>
