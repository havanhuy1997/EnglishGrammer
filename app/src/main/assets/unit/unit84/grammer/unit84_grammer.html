    A. In general we use some (also somebody/someone/something) in positive sentences and any (also anybody etc.) in negative sentences (but see also Sections C and D):<br>
#1 some<br>
* We bought some flowers.<br>
* He's busy. He's got some work to do.<br>
* There's somebody at the door.<br>
* I'm hungry. I want something to eat.<br>
#2 any<br>
* We didn't buy any flowers.<br>
* He's lazy. He never does any work.<br>
* There isn't anybody at the door.<br>
* I'm not hungry. I don't want anything to eat.<br>
We use any in the following sentences because the meaning is negative:<br>
* She went out without any money. (She didn't take any money with her.)<br>
* He refused to eat anything. (He didn't eat anything.)<br>
* Hardly anybody passed the examination. (= almost nobody passed)<br>

</div>


<div class="sec">
	<div class="section"> <B>B</B> <br>In most questions we use any:</div><br>
    * 'Have you got any luggage?' 'No, I haven't.'<br>
* 'Has anybody seen my bag?' 'Yes, it's under the table.'<br>
But we use some in questions when we expect the answer 'yes':<br>
* What's wrong? Have you got something in your eye? (It seems that you have got<br>
something in your eye and I expect you to answer 'yes'.)<br>
We use some in questions when we offer or ask for things:<br>
* Would you like something to eat?<br>
* Can I have some sugar, please?<br>

</div>


<div class="sec">
	<div class="section"> <B>C</B> <br>We often use any after if:</div><br>
    * If there are any letters for me, can you send them on to this address?<br>
* If anyone has any questions, I'll be pleased to answer them.<br>
* Let me know if you need anything.<br>
The following sentences have the idea of if:<br>
* I'm sorry for any trouble I've caused. (= if I have caused any trouble)<br>
* Anyone who wants to do the exam must give me their names today. (= if there is anyone)<br>

</div>


<div class="sec">
	<div class="section"> <B>D</B> <br>We also use any with the meaning 'it doesn't matter which':</div><br>
    * You can catch any bus. They all go to the centre. (= it doesn't matter which bus you catch)<br>
* 'Sing a song.' 'Which song shall I sing?' 'Any song. I don't mind.' (= it doesn't matter which song)<br>
* Come and see me any time you want.<br>
* 'Let's go out somewhere.' 'Where shall we go?' 'Anywhere. I don't mind.'<br>
* We left the door unlocked. Anybody could have come in.<br>
Compare something and anything:<br>
* A: I'm hungry. I want something to eat.<br>
B: What would you like?<br>
A: I don't mind. Anything. (= something, but it doesn't matter what)<br>

</div>


<div class="sec">
	<div class="section"> <B>E</B> <br>Somebody/someone/anybody/anyone are singular words:</div><br>
    * Someone is here to see you.<br>
But we often use they/them/their after these words:<br>
* Someone has forgotten their umbrella. (= his or her umbrella)<br>
* If anybody wants to leave early, they can. (= he or she can)<br>
