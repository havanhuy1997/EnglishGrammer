    Study the difference between will and going to:<br>
Sue is talking to Helen:<br>
SUE: Let's have a party<br>
HELLEN: That's a great idea. We'll invite lots of people.<br>
will ('ll): We use will when we decide to do something at the time of speaking. The speaker has not decided before. The party is a new idea.<br>
Later that day, Helen meets Dave:<br>
HELLEN: Sue and I have decided to have a party. We're going to invite lots of people.<br>
going to: We use (be) going to when we have already decided to do something. Helen had already decided to Invite lots of people before she spoke to Dave.<br>
Compare:<br>
* 'George phoned while you were out.' 'OK. I'll phone him back.'<br>
but * 'George phoned while you were out.' 'Yes, I know. I'm going to phone him back.'<br>
* 'Ann is in hospital.' 'Oh really? I didn't know. I'll go and visit her.'<br>
but * 'Ann is in hospital.' 'Yes, I know. I'm going to visit her tomorrow.'<br>

<div class="sec">
	<div class="section"> <B>B</B> <br>Future happenings and situations (predicting the future)</div><br>
    Sometimes there is not much difference between will and going to. For example, you can say:<br>
* I think the weather will be nice later.<br>
* I think the weather is going to be nice later.<br>
When we say 'something is going to happen', we know (or think) this because of the situation now. For<br>
example:<br>
* Look at those black clouds. It's going to rain. (not 'it will rain' - we can see the clouds now)<br>
* I feel terrible. I think I'm going to be sick. (not 'I think I'll be sick' - I feel terrible now)<br>
Do not use will in situations like these. (See also Unit 20C.)<br>
In other situations, it is safer to use will:<br>
* Tom will probably arrive at about 8 o'clock.<br>
* I think Ann will like the present we bought for her.<br>
