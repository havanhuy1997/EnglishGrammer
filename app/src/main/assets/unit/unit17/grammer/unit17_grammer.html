    We often use have got rather than have alone. So you can say:<br>
* We've got a new car. or We have a new car.<br>
* Ann has got two sisters. or Ann has two sisters.<br>
We use have got or have for illnesses, pains etc.:<br>
* I've got a headache. or I have a headache.<br>
In questions and negative sentences there are three possible forms:<br>
Have you got any money? I haven't got any money.<br>
Do you have any money? I don't have any money.<br>
Have you any money? (less usual) I haven't any money. (less usual)<br>
Has she got a car? She hasn't got a car.<br>
Does she have a car? She doesn't have a car.<br>
Has she a car? (less usual) She hasn't a car. (less usual)<br>
When have means 'possess' etc., you cannot use continuous forms (is having/are having etc.):<br>
* I have/I've got a headache. (not 'I'm having')<br>
For the past we use had (usually without 'got'):<br>
* Ann had long fair hair when she was a child. (not 'Ann had got')<br>
In past questions and negative sentences we normally use did/didn't:<br>
* Did they have a car when they were living in London?<br>
* I didn't have a watch, so I didn't know the time.<br>
* Ann had long fair hair, didn't she?<br>

<div class="sec">
	<div class="section"> <B>B</B> <br>Have breakfast/have a bath/have a good time etc.</div><br>
    Have (but not 'have got') is also used for many actions and experiences. For example:<br>
have breakfast/dinner/a cup of coffee/a cigarette etc.<br>
have a bath/a shower/a swim/a rest/a party/a holiday/a nice time etc.<br>
have an accident/an experience/a dream etc.<br>
have a look (at something)/a chat (with somebody)<br>
have a baby (= give birth to a baby)<br>
have difficulty/trouble/fun<br>
* Goodbye! I hope you have a nice time.<br>
* Mary had a baby recently.<br>
'Have got' is not possible in these expressions. Compare:<br>
* I usually have a sandwich for my lunch. (have = 'eat' - not 'have got')<br>
but * I've got some sandwiches. Would you like one?<br>
In these expressions, have is like other verbs. You can use continuous forms (is having are having etc.)<br>
where suitable:<br>
* I had a postcard from Fred this morning. He's on holiday. He says he's having a wonderful time. (not 'he has a wonderful time')<br>
* The phone rang while we were having dinner. (not 'while we had')<br>
In questions and negative sentences we normally use do/does/did:<br>
* I don't usually have a big breakfast. (not 'I usually haven't')<br>
* What time does Ann have lunch? (not 'has Ann lunch')<br>
* Did you have any difficulty finding somewhere to live?<br>
