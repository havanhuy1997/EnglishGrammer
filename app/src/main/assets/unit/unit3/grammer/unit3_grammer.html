<div class="sec">
	<div class="section"> <B>B</B> <br>I always do and I'm always doing</div><br>
    Usually we say 'I always do something' (= I do it every time):<br>
* I always go to work by car. (not 'I'm always going')<br>
You can also say 'I'm always doing something', but this has a different meaning. For example:<br>
I've lost my key again. I'm always losing things.<br>
'I'm always losing things' does not mean that I lose things every time. It means that I lose things too often, more often than normal.<br>
'You're always ~ing' means that you do something very often, more often than the speaker thinks is normal or reasonable.<br>
* You're always watching television. You should do something more active.<br>
* John is never satisfied. He's always complaining.<br>
