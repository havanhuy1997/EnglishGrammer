	<div class="section"> <B>A</B> <br>We use to ... to say why somebody does something (= the purpose of an action):</div><br>
    * 'Why did you go out?' 'To post a letter.'<br>
* A friend of mine phoned to invite me to a party.<br>
* We shouted to warn everybody of the danger.<br>
We use to... to say why something exists or why somebody has/wants/needs something:<br>

	<div class="section"> <B>B</B> <br>We use to ... to say what can be done or must be done with something:</div><br>
    * It's difficult to find a place to park in the city centre. (= a place where you can park)<br>

<div class="sec">
	<div class="section"> <B>C</B> <br>For ... and to ...</div><br>
    Compare:<br>
* I'm going to Spain for a holiday.<br>
but I'm going to Spain to learn Spanish. (not 'for learn Spanish', not 'for learning Spanish')<br>
We use for + noun (for a holiday) but to + verb (to learn). Some more examples:<br>
* What would you like for dinner?<br>
but What would you like to eat? (not 'for eat')<br>
* Let's go to the pool for a swim.<br>
but Let's go to the pool to have a swim.<br>
Note that you can say ... for (somebody) to (do something):<br>
* There weren't any chairs for us to sit on, so we had to sit on the floor.<br>
You can use for ~ing to say what the general purpose of a thing is. To... is also possible:<br>
* This knife is only for cutting bread. (or ... to cut bread.)<br>
You can use What ... for? to ask about purpose:<br>
* What is this switch for?<br>
* What did you do that for?<br>

</div>


<div class="sec">
	<div class="section"> <B>D</B> <br>So that</div><br>
    Sometimes you have to use so that for purpose. We use so that (not to ...):<br>
i) when the purpose is negative (so that ... won't/wouldn't):<br>
* I hurried so that I wouldn't be late. (= because I didn't want to be late)<br>
* Leave early so that you won't (or don't) miss the bus.<br>
ii) with can and could (so that ... can/could)<br>
* She's learning English so that she can study in Canada.<br>
* We moved to London so that we could visit our friends more often.<br>
iii) when one person does something so that another person does something else:<br>
* I gave her my address so that she could contact me.<br>
* He wore glasses and a false beard so that nobody would recognize him.<br>
