    You want to tell somebody else what Tom said.<br>
There are two ways of doing this:<br>
You can repeat Tom's words (direct speech):<br>
Tom said 'I'm feeling ill.'<br>
Or you can use reported speech:<br>
Tom said that he was feeling ill.<br>
Compare:<br>
direct: Tom said I am feeling ill.' in writing we use these to show direct speech.<br>
reported: Tom said that he was feeling ill.<br>

</div>


<div class="sec">
	<div class="section"> <B>B</B> <br>When we use reported speech, the main verb of the sentence is usually past (Tom said that ... I told her that... etc.). The rest of the sentence is usually past too:</div><br>
    * Tom said that he was feeling ill.<br>
* I told her that I didn't have any money.<br>
You can leave out that:<br>
* Tom said (that) he was feeling ill.<br>
* I told her (that) I didn't have any money.<br>
In general, the present form in direct speech changes to the past form in reported speech:<br>
am/is -> was<br>
do/does -> did<br>
will -> would<br>
are -> were<br>
have/has -> had<br>
can -> could<br>
want/like/know/go etc. -> want/liked/knew/went etc.<br>
Compare direct speech and reported speech:<br>
You met Judy. Here are some of the things she said to you in direct speech:<br>
Judy:<br>
'my parents are very well.'<br>
'I'm going to learn to drive.'<br>
'John has given up his job.'<br>
'I can't come to the party on Friday.'<br>
'I want to go away for a holiday but I don't know where to go.' 'I'm going away for a few days. I'll phone you<br>
when I get back.'<br>
Later you tell somebody what Judy said. You use reported speech:<br>
* Judy said that her parents were very well.<br>
* She said that she was going to learn to drive.<br>
* She said that John had given up his job.<br>
* She said that she couldn't come to the party on Friday.<br>
* She said that she wanted to go away for a holiday but (she) didn't know where to go.<br>
* She said that she was going away for a few days and would phone me when she got back.<br>

<div class="sec">
	<div class="section"> <B>C</B> <br>The past simple (did/saw/knew etc.) can usually stay the same in reported speech, or you can change it to the past Perfect (had done/had seen/had known etc.):</div><br>
    direct: Tom said: 'I woke up feeling ill, so I didn't go to work.'<br>
reported: Tom said (that) he woke up feeling ill, so he didn't go to work. or Tom said (that) he had woken up feeling ill, so he hadn't gone to work.<br>
