    Study this example situation:<br>
This is Tom's diary for next week.<br>
He is playing tennis on Monday afternoon.<br>
He is going to the dentist on Tuesday morning.<br>
He is having dinner with Ann on Friday.<br>
In all these examples, Tom has already decided and arranged to do these things.<br>
Use the present continuous to say what you have already arranged to do. Do not use the present simple do):<br>
* A: What are you doing on Saturday evening? (not 'what do you do')<br>
B: I'm going to the theatre. (not 'I go')<br>
* A: What time is Cathy arriving tomorrow?<br>
B: At 10.30. I'm meeting her at the station.<br>
* I'm not working tomorrow, so we can go out somewhere.<br>
* Ian isn't playing football on Saturday. He's hurt his leg.<br>
'(I'm) going to (do)' is also possible in these sentences:<br>
* What are you going to do on Saturday evening?<br>
But the present continuous is more natural for arrangements. See also Unit 20B.<br>
Do not use will to talk about what you have arranged to do:<br>
* What are you doing this evening? (not 'what will you do')<br>
* Alex is getting married next month. (not 'will get')<br>

<div class="sec">
	<div class="section"> <B>B</B> <br>Present simple (I do) with a future meaning</div><br>
    We use the present simple when we talk about timetables, programmes etc. (for example, for public transport, cinemas etc.):<br>
* The train leaves Plymouth at 11.30 and arrives in London at 14.45.<br>
* What time does the film begin?<br>
* It's Wednesday tomorrow.<br>
You can use the present simple for people if their plans are fixed like a timetable:<br>
* I start my new job on Monday.<br>
* What time do you finish work tomorrow?<br>
But the continuous is more usual for personal arrangements:<br>
* What time are you meeting Ann tomorrow? (not 'do you meet')<br>
Compare:<br>
* What time are you leaving tomorrow?<br>
but * What time does the train leave tomorrow?<br>
* I'm going to the cinema this evening.<br>
but * The film starts at 8.15 (this evening).<br>
