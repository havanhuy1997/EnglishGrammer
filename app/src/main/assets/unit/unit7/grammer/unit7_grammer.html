<div class="sec">
	<div class="section"> <B>A</B> <br>Study this example situation:</div><br>
    Tom is looking for his key. He can't find it. He has lost his key. 'He has lost his key' = He lost it and he still hasn't got it.<br>
Have/has lost is the present perfect simple:<br>
I/we/they/you have (= I've etc.) finished/lost/done/been etc.<br>
he/she/it has (= he's etc.) finished/lost/done/been etc.<br>
The present perfect simple is have/has + past participle. The past participle often ends in -ed<br>
(finished/decided etc.), but many important verbs are irregular (lost/done/been/written etc.). For a list of<br>
irregular verbs, see Appendix 1.<br>

</div>


<div class="sec">
	<div class="section"> <B>B</B> <br>When we use the present perfect there is always a connection with now. The action in the past has a</div><br>
    result now:<br>
* 'Where's your key?' J don't know. I've lost it.' (I haven't got it now)<br>
* He told me his name but I've forgotten it. (I can't remember it now)<br>
* 'Is Sally here?' 'No, she's gone out.' (she is out now)<br>
* I can't find my bag. Have you seen it? (do you know where it is now?)<br>
We often use the present perfect to give new information or to announce a recent happening:<br>
* Ow! I've cut my finger.<br>
* The road is closed. There's been (= there has been) an accident.<br>
* (from the news) The police have arrested two men in connection with the robbery.<br>

</div>


<div class="sec">
	<div class="section"> <B>C</B> <br>You can use the present perfect with just, already and yet:</div><br>
    Just = a short time ago:<br>
* 'Would you like something to eat?' 'No, thanks. I've just had lunch.'<br>
* Hello. Have you just arrived?<br>
We use already to say that something happened sooner than expected (see also Unit 110D).<br>
* 'Don't forget to post the letter, will you?' 'I've already posted it.'<br>
* 'What time is Mark leaving?' 'He's already gone.'<br>
Yet = 'until now' and shows that the speaker is expecting something to happen. Use yet only in questions and negative sentences (see also Unit 110C):<br>
* Has it stopped raining yet?<br>
* I've written the letter but I haven't posted it yet.<br>

<div class="sec">
	<div class="section"> <B>D</B> <br>Note the difference between gone (to) and been (to):</div><br>
    * Jim is away on holiday. He has gone to Spain. (= he is there now or on his way there)<br>
* Jane is back home from holiday now. She has been to Italy. (= she has now come back from Italy)<br>
For been (to) see also Units 8 and 125B.<br>
