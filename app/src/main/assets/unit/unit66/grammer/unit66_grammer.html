    Tom got into his car and drove away. You saw this. You can say:<br>
* I saw Tom get into his car and drive away.<br>
In this structure we use get/drive/do etc. (infinitive without 'to'):<br>
Somebody did something + I saw this = I saw somebody do something.<br>
Note that we use the infinitive without to:<br>
* We saw them go out. (not 'to go')<br>
But after a passive ('they were seen') etc., we use to:<br>
* They were seen to go out.<br>

'I saw him doing something' = he was doing something (past continuous) and I saw this. I saw him when he was in the middle of doing it. This does not mean that I saw the complete action:<br>

* He was walking along the street. + I saw this when I drove past in my car. = I saw him walking along the street.<br>
