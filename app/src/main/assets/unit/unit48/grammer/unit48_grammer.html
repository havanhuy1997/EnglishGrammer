<div class="sec">
	<div class="section"> <B>A</B> <br>We usually make questions by changing the word order: we put the first auxiliary verb (AV) before the subject (S):</div><br>
    Tom will -> will Tom?<br>
* Will Tom be here tomorrow?<br>
you have -> have you?<br>
* Have you been working hard?<br>
I can -> can I?<br>
* What can I do? (not 'What I can do?')<br>
the house was -> was the house?<br>
* When was the house built? (not 'When was built the house?')<br>

</div>


<div class="sec">
	<div class="section"> <B>B</B> <br>In present simple questions, we use do/does:</div><br>
    you live -> do you live?<br>
* Do you live near here?<br>
the film begins -> does the film begin?<br>
* What time does the film begin? (not 'What time begins ...?')<br>
In past simple questions, we use did:<br>
you sold -> did you sell?<br>
* Did you sell your car?<br>
the accident happened -> did the accident happen?<br>
* How did the accident happen?<br>
But do not use do/does/did in questions if who/what/which is the subject of the sentence. Compare:<br>
who object<br>
Emma telephoned _somebody._(object)<br>
_Who_(object) did Emma telephone?<br>
who subject<br>
_Somebody_(subject) telephoned Emma.<br>
_Who_(subject) telephoned Emma?<br>
In these examples, who/what/which is the subject:<br>
* Who wants something to eat? (not 'Who does want')<br>
* What happened to you last night? (not 'What did happen')<br>
* Which bus goes to the city centre? (not 'Which bus does go')<br>

</div>


<div class="sec">
	<div class="section"> <B>C</B> <br>Note the position of prepositions in questions beginning Who/What/Which/Where ...?:</div><br>
    * Who do you want to speak to?<br>
* What was the weather like yesterday?<br>
* Which job has Jane applied for?<br>
* Where do you come from?<br>

</div>


<div class="sec">
	<div class="section"> <B>D</B> <br>Negative questions (isn't it ...?/didn't you ...?)</div><br>
    We use negative questions especially to show surprise:<br>
* Didn't you hear the bell? I rang it four times.<br>
or when we expect the listener to agree with us:<br>
* 'Haven't we met somewhere before 'Yes, I think we have.'<br>
* Isn't it a beautiful day! (= It's a beautiful day, isn't it?)<br>
Note the meaning of yes and no in answers to negative questions:<br>
* Don't you want to go to the party? Yes. (=Yes, I want to go)<br>
* Don't you want to go to the party? .No. (=No, I don't want to go)<br>
Note the word order in negative questions beginning Why ...?:<br>
* Why don't we go out for a meal tonight? (not 'Why we don't...')<br>
* Why wasn't Mary at work yesterday? (not 'Why Mary wasn't...')<br>
