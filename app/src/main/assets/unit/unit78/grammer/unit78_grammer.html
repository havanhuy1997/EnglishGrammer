<div class="sec">
	<div class="section"> <B>A</B> <br>Sometimes we use a plural noun for one thing that has two parts. For example:</div><br>
    trousers (two legs) also jeans/tights/shorts/pants<br>
trousers (two legs) also jeans/tights/shorts/pants pyjamas (top and bottom)<br>
trousers (two legs) also jeans/tights/shorts/pants pyjamas (top and bottom) glasses (or spectacles)<br>
trousers (two legs) also jeans/tights/shorts/pants pyjamas (top and bottom) glasses (or spectacles) binoculars<br>
trousers (two legs) also jeans/tights/shorts/pants pyjamas (top and bottom) glasses (or spectacles) binoculars scissors<br>
These words are plural, so they take a plural verb:<br>
* My trousers are too long. (not 'is too long')<br>
You can also use a pair of + these words:<br>
* Those are nice jeans. or That's a nice pair of jeans. (not 'a nice jeans')<br>
* I need some new glasses. or I need a new pair of glasses.<br>

</div>


<div class="sec">
	<div class="section"> <B>B</B> <br>Some nouns end in -ics but are not usually plural. For example: athletics gymnastics mathematics</div><br>
    (or maths) physics electronics economics politics<br>
* Gymnastics is my favourite sport.<br>
News is not plural (see Unit 69C):<br>
* What time is the news on television? (not 'are the news')<br>
Some words ending in -s can be singular or plural. For example:<br>
means a means of transport many means of transport<br>
means a means of transport many means of transport series a television series two television series<br>
means a means of transport many means of transport series a television series two television series species a species of bird 200 species of bird<br>

<div class="sec">
	<div class="section"> <B>C</B> <br>Some singular nouns are often used with a plural verb. For example:</div><br>
    government staff team family audience committee company firm<br>
These nouns are all groups of people. We often think of them as a number of people (= 'they'), not as one<br>
These nouns are all groups of people. We often think of them as a number of people (= 'they'), not as one thing (= 'it'). So we often use a plural verb:<br>
* The government (= they) want to increase taxes.<br>
* The staff at the school (= they) are not happy with their new working conditions.<br>
In the same way, we often use a plural verb after the name of a sports team or a company:<br>
* Scotland are playing France next week (in a football match).<br>
* Shell have increased the price of petrol.<br>
A singular verb (The government wants.../Shell has... etc.) is also possible.<br>
We always use a plural verb with police:<br>
* The police have arrested a friend of mine. (not 'The police has')<br>
* Do you think the police are well-paid?<br>
Note that a person in the police is 'a policeman/a policewoman/a police officer' (not 'a police').<br>

</div>


<div class="sec">
	<div class="section"> <B>D</B> <br>We do not often use the plural of person ('persons'). We normally use people (a plural word):</div><br>
    * He's a nice person. but They are nice people.<br>
* Many people don't have enough to eat. (not 'doesn't have')<br>

</div>


<div class="sec">
	<div class="section"> <B>E</B> <br>We think of a sum of money, a period of time, a distance etc. as one thing. So we use a singular verb:</div><br>
    * Twenty thousand pounds (= it) was stolen in the robbery. (not 'were stolen')<br>
* Three years (= it) is a long time to be without a job. (not 'Three years are ...')<br>
* Six miles is a long way to walk every day.<br>
