	<div class="section"> <B>A</B> <br>Study this example situation:</div><br>
    Dennis stopped smoking two years ago. He doesn't smoke any more.<br>
But he used to smoke.<br>
He used to smoke 40 cigarettes a day.<br>
'He used to smoke' = he smoked regularly for some time in the past, but he doesn't smoke now. He was a smoker, but now he isn't<br>

</div>


<div class="sec">
	<div class="section"> <B>B</B> <br>'Something used to happen' = something happened regularly in the past but no longer happens:</div><br>
    * I used to play tennis a lot but I don't play very often now.<br>
* Diane used to travel a lot. These days she doesn't go away so often.<br>
* 'Do you go to the cinema very often?' 'Not now, but I used to.' (= I used to go ...)<br>
We also use used to... for something that was true but is not true any more:<br>
* This building is now a furniture shop. It used to be a cinema.<br>
* I used to think he was unfriendly but now I realise he's a very nice person.<br>
* I've started drinking coffee recently. I never used to like it before.<br>
* Janet used to have very long hair when she was a child.<br>

<div class="sec">
	<div class="section"> <B>C</B> <br>'I used to do something' is past. There is no present form. You cannot say 'I use to do'. To talk about the present, use the present simple (I do).</div><br>
    Compare:<br>
past: he used to smoke we used to live there used to be<br>
present: he smokes we live there is<br>
* We used to live in a small village but now we live in London.<br>
* There used to be four cinemas in the town. Now there is only one.<br>

</div>


<div class="sec">
	<div class="section"> <B>D</B> <br>The normal question form is did (you) use to ...?:</div><br>
    * Did you use to eat a lot of sweets when you were a child?<br>
The negative form is didn't use to ... (used not to ... is also possible)<br>
* I didn't use to like him. (or I used not to like him.)<br>

</div>


<div class="sec">
	<div class="section"> <B>E</B> <br>Compare I used to do and I was doing (see Unit 6):</div><br>
    * I used to watch TV a lot. (= I watched TV regularly in the past, but I no longer do this)<br>
* I was watching TV when the phone rang. (= I was in the middle of watching TV)<br>

</div>


<div class="sec">
	<div class="section"> <B>F</B> <br>Do not confuse I used to do and I am used to doing (see Unit 60). The structures and meanings are different:</div><br>
    * I used to live alone. (= I lived alone in the past but I no longer live alone)<br>
* I am used to living alone. (= I live alone and I don't find it strange or new because I've been living alone for some time)<br>
