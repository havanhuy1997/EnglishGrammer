	<div class="section"> <B>A</B> <br>Study this example situation:</div><br>
    Yesterday Karen and Jim played tennis. They began at 10 o'clock and finished at 11.30. So, at 10.30 they<br>
were playing tennis.<br>
They were playing = 'they were in the middle of playing'. They had not finished playing.<br>
Was/were ~ing is the past continuous:<br>
I/he/she/it was playing/doing/working etc.<br>
we/you/they were playing/doing/working etc.<br>

</div>


<div class="sec">
	<div class="section"> <B>B</B> <br>We use the past continuous to say that somebody was in the middle of doing something at a certain</div><br>
    time. The action or situation had already started before this time but had not finished:<br>
* This time last year I was living in Brazil.<br>
* What were you doing at 10 o'clock last night?<br>
* I waved to her but she wasn't looking.<br>

</div>


<div class="sec">
	<div class="section"> <B>C</B> <br>Compare the past continuous (I was doing) and past simple (I did):</div><br>
    Past continuous (in the middle of an action)<br>
* I was walking home when I met Dave. (= in the middle of walking home)<br>
* Ann was watching television when the phone rang.<br>
Past simple (complete action)<br>
* I walked home after the party last night. (= all the way, completely)<br>
* Ann watched television a lot when she was ill last year.<br>

</div>


<div class="sec">
	<div class="section"> <B>D</B> <br>We often use the past simple and the past continuous together to say that something happened in the middle of something else:</div><br>
    * Tom burnt his hand when he was cooking the dinner.<br>
* I saw you in the park yesterday. You were sitting on the grass and reading a book.<br>
* While I was working in the garden, I hurt my back.<br>
But we use the past simple to say that one thing happened after another:<br>
* I was walking along the road when I saw Dave. So I stopped and we had a chat.<br>
Compare:<br>
* When Karen arrived, we were having dinner. (= We had already started dinner before Karen arrived.)<br>
* When Karen arrived, we had dinner. (= First Karen arrived and then we had<br>
dinner.)<br>
There are some verbs (for example, know/want/believe) that are not normally used in the continuous(see Unit 4A):<br>
* We were good friends. We knew each other well. (not 'we were knowing')<br>
* I was enjoying the party but Chris wanted to go home. (not 'was wanting')<br>
