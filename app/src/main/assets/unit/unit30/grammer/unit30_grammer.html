<div class="sec">
	<div class="section"> <B>A</B> <br>We use may and might to talk about possible actions or happenings in the future:</div><br>
    * I haven't decided yet where to spend my holidays. I may go to Ireland. (= perhaps I will go to Ireland)<br>
* Take an umbrella with you when you go out. It might rain later. (= perhaps it will rain)<br>
* The bus doesn't always come on time. We might have to wait a few minutes. (= perhaps we will have to wait)<br>
The negative forms are may not and might not (mightn't):<br>
* Ann may not come to the party tonight. She isn't well. (= perhaps she will not come)<br>
* There might not be a meeting on Friday because the director is ill. (= perhaps there will not be a meeting)<br>

</div>


<div class="sec">
	<div class="section"> <B>B</B> <br>Usually it doesn't matter whether you use may or might. So you can say:</div><br>
    * I may go to Ireland. or I might go to Ireland.<br>
* Jane might be able to help you. or Jane may be able to help you.<br>
But we use only might (not may) when the situation is not real:<br>
* If I knew them better, I might invite them to dinner. (The situation here is not real because I don't know them very well, so I'm not going to invite them. 'May' is not possible in this example.)<br>

</div>


<div class="sec">
	<div class="section"> <B>C</B> <br>There is also a continuous form: may/might be ~ing. Compare this with will be ~ing:</div><br>
    * Don't phone at 8.30. I'll be watching the football on television.<br>
* Don't phone at 8.30. I might be watching (or I may be watching) the football on television. (= perhaps I'll be watching it)<br>
For will be ~ing see Unit 24.<br>
We also use may/might be ~ing for possible plans. Compare:<br>
* I'm going to Ireland in July. (for sure)<br>
* I may be going (or I might be going) to Ireland in July. (possible)<br>
But you can also say 'I may go (or I might go) to Ireland...' with little difference of meaning.<br>

</div>


<div class="sec">
	<div class="section"> <B>D</B> <br>Might as well/may as well</div><br>
    Study this example:<br>
Helen and Clare have just missed the bus. The buses run every hour.<br>
Helen: What shall we do? Shall we walk?<br>
Clare: We might as well. It's a nice day and I don't want to wait here for an hour.<br>
'(We) might as well do something'= (We) should do something because there is nothing better to do and there is no reason not to do it.<br>
You can also say 'may as well'.<br>
* A: What time are you going?<br>
B: Well, I'm ready, so I might as well go now. (or ... I may as well go now)<br>
* The buses are so expensive these days, you might as well get a taxi. (= taxis are just as good, no more expensive)<br>
