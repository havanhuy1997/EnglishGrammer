    The verb and the object of the verb normally go together. We do not usually put other words between<br>
The verb and the object of the verb normally go together. We do not usually put other words between them:<br>
I like children very much. (not 'l like very much children')<br>
Did you see your friends yesterday?<br>
Ann often plays tennis<br>
Study these -examples. Notice how the verb and the object go together each time:<br>
* Do you clean the house every weekend? (not 'Do you clean every weekend the house?')<br>
* Everybody enjoyed the party very much. (not 'Everybody enjoyed very much the party')<br>
* Our guide spoke English fluently. (not '...spoke fluently English')<br>
* I not only lost all my money - I also lost my passport. (not 'I lost also my passport')<br>
* At the end of the street you'll see a supermarket on your left. (not '...see on your left a supermarket')<br>

<div class="sec">
	<div class="section"> <B>B</B> <br>Place and time</div><br>
    Usually the verb and the place (where?) go together:<br>
go home, live in a city, walk to work etc.<br>
If the verb has an object, the place comes after the verb + object:<br>
take somebody home, meet a friend in the street<br>
Time (when?/how often?/how long?) normally goes after place:<br>
Tom walks to work every morning. (not 'Tom walks every morning to work')<br>
She has been in Canada since April.<br>
We arrived at the airport early.<br>
Study these examples. Notice how time goes after place:<br>
* I'm going to Paris on Monday. (not 'I'm going on Monday to Paris')<br>
* They have lived in the same house for a long time.<br>
* Don't be late. Make sure you're here by 8 o'clock.<br>
* Sarah gave me a lift home after the party.<br>
* You really shouldn't go to bed so ate.<br>
It is often possible to put time at the beginning of the sentence:<br>
* On Monday I'm going to Paris.<br>
* Every morning Tom walks to work.<br>
Some time words (for example, always/never/often) usually go with the verb in the middle of the sentence.<br>
